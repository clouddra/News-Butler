    Ireland's selectors have been handed a dilemma after Catriona Jennings became the fourth Irish woman to run inside the 'A' standard for the Olympics.
    Only three can be included in the Irish athletics team for the London Games.
    Jennings, from Donegal, ran a lifetime best of two hours, 36 minutes and 14 seconds in Rotterdam on Sunday.
    It made her the second-fastest among the Irish runners who have met the qualifying requirement, behind Ava Hutchinson's 2:35.33.
    The other Irish women to have run inside the 2:37.00 standard are Linda Byrne and Maria McCambridge.
    Athletics Ireland will announce which runners are being nominated on 14 May, and then the final selection decision will be made by the Olympic Council of Ireland.
    Three Irish male runners - Sean Connolly, Gary Thornton and Thomas Frazier - fell short of the 2:15.00 Oympic target time in Rotterdam.
