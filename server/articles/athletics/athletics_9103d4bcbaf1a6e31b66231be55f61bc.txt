    Britain's Helen Jenkins finished second in the opening round of the World Triathlon Series in Sydney.
    The 
    
reigning world champion 

     was beaten by Australia's Erin Densham, who won with a time of 2hr 1min 29sec.
    Great Britain's triathlon world champion Alistair Brownlee and his brother Jonny did not participate in the men's event. 
    Alistair, 
    
who is recovering from a torn Achilles, 

     and Jonny 
    
have already qualified for the Olympics. 
    1. Erin Densham (Aus) 2hr 1min 29sec 
    2. Helen Jenkins (GB) 2:01.38
    3. Andrea Hewitt (NZ) 2:01.45
    4. Gwen Jorgensen (USA) 2:02.12
    5. Nicola Spirig (Swi) 2:02.19
    Jenkins was pleased with a podium finish in the first race of the series, and is happy with her overall preparation ahead of the Olympic event, which takes place in Hyde Park on 4 August.
    "Normally it takes me a few races to warm up, so to come out and get a podium performance is brilliant," she said.
    "My winter training has gone well, and ahead of the next race in San Diego I'll get another block of training in.
    "I will try to keep progressing from this race, looking forward towards the Olympics."
    Densham, who had surgery two years ago to correct an accelerated heart rate, finished nine seconds ahead of Jenkins.
    The 26-year-old outpaced the British athlete in the final kilometre of the run to record her second victory in three weeks on the international circuit, following her World Cup win on Queensland's Sunshine Coast on 25 March.
    1. Steffen Justus (Ger) 1 hr 51min 4sec
    2. Richard Murray (SA) 1:51.13
    3. Laurent Vidal (Fra) 1:51.15
    4. David Hauss (Fra) 1:51.30
    5. Alexander Bryukhankov (Rus) 1:51.31
    "There was more pressure today in knowing what I could do and coming to do it again," Densham said.
    "I am sure there were probably a few people who thought it was a one-off, so I am just glad I have done it again and hopefully I can put some of those doubters to rest."
    Germany's Steffen Justus won the opening round of the men's World Triathlon Series with a time of 1hr 51min 4sec.
    Justus pulled away on the run leg to beat South African Richard Murray, who became the first African to record a podium finish in the event.
    Frenchman Laurent Vidal finished third.
    The second World Championship Series event is 10-12 May in San Diego, followed by Madrid from 26-27 May.
