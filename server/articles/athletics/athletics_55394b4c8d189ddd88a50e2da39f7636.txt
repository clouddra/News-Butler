    Triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt wants to "amaze" the world at London 2012 by running 9.4 seconds for the 100m and 19 seconds for the 200m.
    Jamaican Bolt, 25, is the reigning Olympic champion and world-record holder over both distances, with times of 9.58secs and 19.19secs.
    "People are looking forward to me running 9.4, 19 seconds, anything that's amazing," Bolt told BBC Sport.
    "So I'm working as hard as possible so I can go as fast as possible."

     Bolt added that more performances, such as the ones that saw him take three gold medals at the 2008 Olympics, would make him "a living legend".
    "They want to see my personality, me enjoying it and doing crazy stuff, but they also want to see that time," he said.
    "If I dominate the Olympics, I'll be a living legend. A living legend walking around. Sounds good."

American swimmer Michael Phelps,  

     a 14-time Olympic champion, said he hoped London would be the perfect ending to a stellar career.
    "Being able to prepare myself to look back through my career and say I've done everything I've wanted and I've been successful is something I really want to do," said the 26-year-old.
