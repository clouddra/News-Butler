As it was the Wolves held a narrow 14-13 advantage after ten minutes.Couisnard gave Riders their first lead of the match at 15-14 but a 12-3 run by Wolves saw them hold the biggest margin of the half with the score at 26-18.Riders responded to tie it at 29-29 on an Downing three before free throws from Zaire Taylor and Will Creekmore edged Wolves 34-31 ahead at the interval.A three by Taylor capped an 8-0 start to the third quarter for Wolves which put them up 43-31 - their largest lead of the match.Again the Riders fought back to gradually whittle away the Wolves advantage.Two threes by Sullivan - one at the start of the 18-7 burst, and one at the end - ensured the Riders would be behind by just one (50-49) heading into the final stanza.
