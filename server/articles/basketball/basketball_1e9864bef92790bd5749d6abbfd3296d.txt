Brett Brown: Led Australia to the quarter-finals at London 2012New Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown is relishing his return to the UK for the pre-season clash with the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday.The 76ers will face the Thunder at the Phones 4u Arena in Manchester, the contest being part of a 2013-14 'Global Games' schedule which will also see an NBA regular-season game take place at the O2 Arena in January.Brown, who has fond memories of coaching Australia at London 2012, knows his young Philadelphia side will be up against it when they face a team which finished with the second-best record in the league last season."We're playing against a great team. I love England and have great memories of the city from the Olympic Games and we're excited to for the game," he said."It is good to play against a great team in a great city like Manchester."At last year's Olympics, Team GB saw their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals ended when they suffered a 106-75 defeat to Brown's Australia.The hosts led 46-36 at half-time but Australia broke free after the interval to inflict a painful defeat.Brown added: "We know the competitive rivalry between Great Britain and Australia."Whether it is cricket, whether it is rugby, whether it is basketball, whether it is ping pong - they don't like losing to one another."We were down a lot in that game and the game swung and we ended up winning by 30. (We) went on a 52-10 run! It was a loud crowd and a passionate moment for my team - a moment I am very proud of.  I don't remember being part of such a dramatic change."
