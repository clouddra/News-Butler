Paul James: Worcester Wolves head coach masterminded overtime victoryPaul James and his Worcester Wolves side squeezed past London Lions 63-62 in overtime at the Copper Box Arena.Both teams struggled to find their range during the initial exchanges, with defences on top and that was a trend which would continue.The Wolves opened a 20-16 advantage but by half-time, they had increased their lead to double-digits at 37-27 thanks to good work from Alex Owumi on both sides of the three-point line.With Matthew Bryan-Amaning coming off the bench and proving a defensive presence for the hosts, the Lions managed to haul themselves back into contention in the second half.Helped by the dangerous Zaire Taylor being slowed down with a hip injury sustained earlier in the game, the Lions were able to turn the tables and stop Wolves scoring for long periods, even if the visitors did still lead 45-35 after an Owumi triple.A succession of blocks by Bryan-Amaning sparked the Lions into life and he went on to complete the comeback when he tied the game up with a jump shot.The Lions even led 56-51 with less than a minute remaining but, in the play of the game, an 'and-1' by Jamal Williams gave the Wolves fresh impetus when it mattered and Lions twice missed their chance to win.Firstly turning the ball over as Stefan Djukic gleefully scored on the fast- reak for the Wolves and then not executing on the last play of regulation.The Wolves took their second chance with relish in the extra period, although Joe Ikhinmwin missed a jump shot that would have won it for the Lions with just three seconds remaining.
