Darius Defoe on target for NewcastleEsh Group Eagles Newcastle made it three wins in a row, taking a share of  second in the BBL Championship, after comprehensively sweeping aside Birmingham Knights by 129-70 at Sport Central.It leaves the Knights with two defeats from their opening two games, both on the road and against last season's top two; they now look forward to hosting One Health Sharks Sheffield tomorrow, currently joint-top/second with the Eagles.Amazingly, all five of the Newcastle's starters recorded double-doubles: Malik Cooke leading with 27 points and 14 rebounds, Scott Martin with 24 & 16, Drew Lasker with 17 and 10, and 21 and 12 for Darius Defoe; while Paul Gause had 22 points and 11 assists.The hosts raced into a 5-0 lead, all scored by Gause, only for the Knights to take their only lead of the game as Brent Benson hit a triple and Michael Gayle made an 'and-one' play.But Gause was there again shortly afterwards with an old-fashioned three-point play to make the score 12-6, and they didn't stop there: Lasker hit five in a row and Defoe added five in what became a 23-4 run with the Eagles marauding. They never looked back, leading 55-34 by the half with Martin the first to his double-double, with 16 points and 11 boards.The Eagles rediscovered their irrepressible scoring groove in the third period, racking up 21 points in five minutes as Cooke's five in a row pushed the lead through 30 points at 76-45.They went on to score 41 in the third, falling just four points short of what would have been a remarkable thirty-minute century, with the score at 96-51.The score went through 100 after a minute of the fourth quarter, and the lead peaked at 124-60. They scored 80 points in the paint at 35 points off turnovers, after 17 steals.Worcester Wolves went top of the league, and remained unbeaten after four games, prevailing through overtime for the second consecutive night as they beat Cheshire Phoenix 94-90 with a late salvo from Will Creekmore and Zaire Taylor.Creekmore had an astonishing game, with 28 points and 22 rebounds, including crucial late scores, and Taylor had 27 points, nine rebounds and six assists.
