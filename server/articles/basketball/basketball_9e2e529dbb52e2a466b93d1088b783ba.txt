WASHINGTON (AP) -- Georgetown says the NCAA has cleared center Josh Smith to play basketball immediately, starting with the Hoyas' opener against Oregon in Seoul, South Korea.Georgetown adds Wednesday that Smith was granted a waiver for last season, when he played in six games before transferring from UCLA, meaning he has two years of eligibility remaining.Coach John Thompson III says Smith, listed at 6-foot-10 and 350 pounds in the Hoyas' media guide, ''has to maintain a high level of commitment on and off the court.''Georgetown faces Oregon on Nov. 8.
