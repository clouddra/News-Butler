Simon Dyson: Yorkshireman to face disciplinary hearingSimon Dyson has been summoned to appear before a European Tour disciplinary panel.The hearing has been called after the Yorkshireman was disqualified from last week's BMW Masters for signing for an incorrect score.Dyson was in joint-second place at Lake Malaren in Shanghai when he was thrown out of the tournament after an incident during his second round which he had "no recollection of" according to officials.The 35-year-old failed to add a two-shot penalty to his card on the eighth hole when he touched the line of his putt after marking his ball, an incident which was noticed by a television viewer.Having reviewed the incident, European Tour officials concluded that further action was required under the Tour's code of behaviour and disciplinary procedure, which states: "3. Serious Breach. If, at the conclusion of an investigation into an alleged breach of the code by a member, it is evident that a serious breach of the code may have occurred, then a disciplinary hearing shall take place before an independent disciplinary panel."Under European Tour regulations, the three-person panel will comprise an independent lawyer, an ex-member of the European Tour or current player on the European Senior Tour and an experienced sports administrator.

If Dyson is found guilty of a serious breach of the code, the Tour's statement added that it can impose sanctions which range from "a reprimand, a censure, a fine, a suspension of membership, a suspension from participation in one or more tournaments or for a given period, or expulsion from the European Tour, or otherwise as the panel shall determine."Dyson insists the violation was unintentional and has welcomed the hearing.He said: "I have been informed of the procedure being put in place by The Tour following my actions during the second round of the BMW Masters in Shanghai last week and am perfectly happy to co-operate with the investigation by the independent disciplinary panel."I would like to say at this stage that I have never deliberately broken the rules either on this occasion or in the past."It was only after I was shown the replay of my action ... that I realised what I had done and that I was in breach. I immediately accepted that I should be disqualified."It was simply an accidental mistake which I have no reservations in apologising for, and particularly to my fellow professionals and The Tour for any inconvenience and embarrassment unintentionally caused."
