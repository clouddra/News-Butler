    Rory McIlroy says he is getting back to his best after finishing joint second in the Korean Open.
    The 24-year-old Northern Irishman carded five birdies 
    
in his final round 

     to finish a shot behind winner Kang Sung-hoon.

“If I can get the putting right, hopefully I'll have a chance”
    "Things are definitely on the up," said McIlroy. "I feel like I'm getting back to where I need to be.
    "I've had to stay patient this season - it hasn't been one of my best - but it's getting there, it definitely is."
    It was McIlroy's second top-five finish of a difficult year in which he has slipped to 
    
sixth in the world rankings.
    The former world number one was 10 shots off the lead after three rounds in Korea but fired an impressive 67 to finish on five under par.
    McIlroy will play in the 
    
BMW Masters  

     on Thursday before taking part in the 
    
HSBC WGC Championships  

     a week later. Both tournaments are in Shanghai.
    "I'm excited about these next two weeks in China," McIlroy said. "They're a big two weeks for me to get a little bit of momentum for the end of the season and going into 2014.
    "My putter let me down in the last couple of days [in Korea]. If I can get the putting right, hopefully I'll have a chance."
