Luke Guthrie: Solid day's workBMW Masters leader Luke Guthrie was more than content with his second round at Lake Malaren despite not hitting the heights of the opening day.Guthrie added a 71 to his opening 65 to finish at eight-under par in Shanghai and that was good enough to extend his overnight leader from three shots to four.English duo Simon Dyson and Paul Casey, Scottish pair Scott Jamieson and Craig Lee, Argentina's Ricardo Gonzalez and Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee are now his nearest challenges on four-under."I think anything in the red today was a good score. The winds were back up, it was a little cooler even and I forgot my sweater so I was a little cold out there," said Guthrie, who made the 7,000-mile journey to China after finishing fifth on the PGA Tour in Las Vegas on Sunday."I played solid again, made a few more bogeys which was disappointing and hit a few poor shots, but hung in there and posted something in the red.
    "I think the weather is maybe supposed to get a little better so I'll have to come out here ready to go and put some red numbers on the board."

"It's only halfway, there is so much more golf to go. I think the weather is maybe supposed to get a little better so I'll have to come out here ready to go and put some red numbers on the board."The 23-year-old's lead fluctuated throughout the round and was finally reduced to a single shot when Dyson birdied the par-five 15th, only for Guthrie to follow with his own birdie minutes later in the group behind.Dyson then ran up a double-bogey six on the 18th after needing two shots to escape from a greenside bunker, while Guthrie holed from 20ft for a birdie on the 17th before a bogey on the last."It's a tough course and anything under par is good, but it's a shame to double the last like I did," said Dyson, who at 66th in the Race to Dubai is looking to climb into the top 60 to qualify for the season-ending DP World Tour Championship in Dubai next month."I didn't hit a bad drive and it kicked right into the rough. It wasn't a great lie and I maybe tried to do too much with it, it snagged way left on me and I had a 30-yard bunker shot that was semi-plugged."I left it in the bunker, thought I hit a good bunker shot for my fourth, but it didn't get any spin and released about 12ft past and I missed it coming back; easy to make a six, you do all that hard work and drop two shots at the last but apart from that I was really pleased."
