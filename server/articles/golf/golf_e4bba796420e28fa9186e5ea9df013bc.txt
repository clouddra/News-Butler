David Lynn: Chasing pack couldn't match his clubhouse targetEnglishman David Lynn ended his nine-year wait for a second European Tour success by shooting a superb final round 63 to win the Portugal Masters.Despite finishing runner-up in last year's US PGA Championship and enjoying an excellent 2013 season on the PGA Tour, the Englishman hadn't won in Europe since capturing the 2004 KLM Open 224 starts ago.He changed all that after a brilliant eight-under par closing round at the Oceanico Victoria Golf Course saw him set a clubhouse target of 18-under which none of the chasing pack could reach.

He battled back gamely to birdie 17 and 18 (with a huge putt) to post level par 71.Welshman Jamie Donaldson was another with a sense of what might have been after sharing sixth place on 15-under with South African Hennie Otto.Donaldson reached 16-under with a birdie at 12 but three-putted from four feet to turn a birdie into a bogey at 13 and he could only par in from there.Scott Jamieson, who shot a record-equalling 60 in round three, couldn't find any spark on Sunday and a one-over 72 dropped him back to tied 13th.
