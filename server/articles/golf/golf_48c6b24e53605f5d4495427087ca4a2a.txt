Rory McIlroy: Opening round of 70 in Korea 'not too bad'Rory McIlroy was pleased to shake off the rust with an opening round of 70 at the Kolon Korea Open.McIlroy had not played competitively in a month and showed signs early on that his game needed a little more work, although his form did improve noticeably in the closing holes.He bounced back from a double bogey at the 13th, where his tee-shot found the water, and picked up three birdies in the last five holes to close within three strokes of early leader Jang Ik-Jae."I felt I was a little rusty after the four weeks off, but I battled back nicely and to end up under par for the day wasn't too bad," McIlroy said."(On 13) I just wasn't very comfortable with the tee shot. I took a long time to get settled over it and then just didn't make a very good swing."It was tough, some of the pin positions out there today were brutal, just cut on slopes and very hard to get close to them and when you did get close to them you left yourself very tricky putts."
