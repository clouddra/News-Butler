I played nice, kept control of my golf ball well, hit it close a few times and holed a few putts," he said."I've been playing better for the last few months; I lost by one in Valencia, two in Gleneagles, been knocking on the door a few times so it's nice to keep myself in contention week on week."Waring, playing on a medical exemption after an operation on a serious wrist injury, is currently 86th on the Race to Dubai and added: "If I can get into one of these big four events (the inaugural Final Series) at the end of the season that would be great."Chris Doak, who had five birdies and an eagle in his flawless 64 and is yet to drop a shot this week, is trying hard to remain in the moment."I'm very pleased," said the 35-year-old from Glasgow, who is 112th on the Race to Dubai with only the top 110 after next week's Perth International keeping their full playing privileges for next season."Especially bogey-free for two rounds, anybody will take that. It's a job well done. The mind tends to race so I am just trying to relax and when you are relaxed you can execute the shots properly and that's what I have done the last two days."
