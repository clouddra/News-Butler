I definitely could have been a few shots better, but I'm in a good position going into the weekend and that's all you can ask for."I don't need to go out there and be overly aggressive, but I just want to get myself into a good position for Sunday if possible."South Korean Hong is one stroke clear of three more local players. The trio on four under includes Hyung-tae Kim, whose round of 66 was the best of the day.McIlroy was a stroke further back along with Ik-jae Yang after the overnight leader could only manage a second round of 72.
