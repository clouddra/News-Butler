I played good today and we are excited about tomorrow. I am driving the ball well which helps when the course is playing wet and long like this.Moore had looked set to bogey the last after finding rough off the tee and with his second shot, but salvaged par to card a round of 70."I got myself in a bit of trouble down 18 and fortunately was able to scramble and make a par and still be in this thing," he said.Moore admitted he felt "less than fantastic" over his crucial putt, but added: "Any time you face a putt you have to make it makes it that much harder, but you just try and step up and hit it like you normally do."Stroud came close to chipping in on the last for a birdie to join the play-off, while Aphibarnrat was left to rue a bogey on the 10th and his inability to find  birdie on the last eight holes.
