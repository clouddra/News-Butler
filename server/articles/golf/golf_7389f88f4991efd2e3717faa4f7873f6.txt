    Kettering's Charley Hull says she "wasn't really that nervous" after defeating USA's Paula Creamer 5&4 to help Europe to an 
    
18-10 Solheim Cup victory in Colorado.
    Caroline Hedwall of Sweden describes the victory as "definitely the biggest moment of my life golf-wise" after becoming the first player in the history of the trophy to win all five of her matches.
    As well as a first win on foreign soil, it was the first time Europe have retained the trophy since the competition was first played in 1990.
