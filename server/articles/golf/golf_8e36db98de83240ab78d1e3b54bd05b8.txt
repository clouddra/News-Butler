Presidents Cup - Day 4 blogWayne Riley believes the Internationals need to develop their depth if they want to end the United States' supremacy in the Presidents Cup.The US, who needed just four points from Sunday's 12 singles to retain the Cup, made it eight wins in 10 attempts on Sunday by beating the Internationals 18½-15½.The Internationals did fight back to win seven-and-a-half of the matches to stall the US victory celebrations but Tiger Woods kept his cool to hold off Richard Sterne and bank the winning point.United States beat battling Internationals 18.5-15.5 at Muirfield Village"Wasn't it just great - so close but yet so far," said Riley. "The internationals made a stellar comeback but it just wasn't good enough because they had too much to do."The depth in this American team is just way too strong - they go down a long way. There are just so many guys who missed out. Jim Furyk missed out, okay maybe the course is a little bit too long for him, but they have just got a lot of depth. The international team has not got such depth and we seriously need to work on that."Riley also believes that the format of the Cup should be changed so it mirrors the format of the Ryder Cup."I think they should look at that, three days like in the Ryder Cup. Four seems to drag on a bit with a lot of four-balls," he reflected."I think it should be three days because of the 12 single matches; it should be decided on those 12 matches."We are very much looking forward to the next President's Cup in two years' time in Korea. We might see changes and for the goodness of this competition maybe we should."
