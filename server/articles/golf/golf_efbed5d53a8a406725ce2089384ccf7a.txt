Phil Mickelson with caddie Jim 'Bones' Mackay during the pro-am for the WGC-HSBC ChampionsPhil Mickelson is confident his game is now in good enough shape for him to make a run at a third title in Sheshan at the WGC-HSBC Champions this week.By his own admission, the Open Champion struggled for any real consistency whilst competing at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia last week.Although he managed to manufacture a respectable 19th-placed finish in Kuala Lumpur, the 43-year-old insisted he had plenty of faults that needed ironing out."I don't have the control of the swing that I'd like. I'm not sure what side I'm going to miss it on. It was closer today, the rhythm was a little bit better but technically, I've got a lot of issues," he said at the halfway point in Malaysia.But Mickelson appears to have made rapid progress in the past few days and admits a spring has returned to his step ahead of this week's event in Shanghai.The American has a stellar record at the Sheshan International Golf Club having triumphed there twice before, including when the tournament first took on World Golf Championship status in 2009.With so many good memories to draw on, the five-time major champion is now hoping to finish 2013 in style."I would love to finish strong," he told reporters ahead of Thursday's first round."I was not swinging well in Malaysia (but) the last two days my game started to come around and as I enter this tournament, I enter with a lot more confidence than I've had in a while."I feel the ball-striking is getting better, the rhythm is getting better."Sheshan is a golf course that I feel very comfortable on. I feel like I know how to play this course successfully, and I'm looking forward to the week."
