    Rory McIlroy says that his form is back where it needs to be after showing glimpses of his best play at the Korean Open, where he finished second.
    The two-time major winner has a had a poor year without any tournament wins but a
    
 final round of 67 saw him finish behind Korean Kang Sung-hoon last weekend.
    It has not been easy for the Northern Irishman off the course either with him 
    
taking his former agent, Horizon Sports Management, to court over a dispute over fees.
