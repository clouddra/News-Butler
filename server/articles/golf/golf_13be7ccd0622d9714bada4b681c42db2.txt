The Englishman - who played in the 2004 and 2006 Ryder Cups and once reached ninth spot in the rankings - has risen back inside the world's top 100 with his success in Scotland and is also up to 12th in the Race to Dubai standings.And Boxall was impressed by the way Howell - who finished tied with Uihlein at 23-under-par, a stroke clear of Tom Lewis and Shane Lowry, after 72 holes - wrapped up his long-awaited triumph."David is a popular winner because he has been around a long time," said Boxall, whose solitary victory on the European Tour came at the 1990 Italian Open."He used to be the best 'holer-outer' from 10 feet and under and holed one like that on the final hole to finish with a birdie which is always nice."It was thoroughly deserved victory."Boxall - who tied for 44th in the 1996 Open Championship at Royal St Lytham when America's Tom Lehman lifted the Claret Jug - also enjoyed the thrilling end to the Alfred Dunhill Links, which was contested across St Andrews, Carnoustie and Kingsbarns."Even Thomas Levet, who finished in a tie for seventh, was right up there at one point and Ricardo Gonzalez was moving on nicely," added the player-turned-pundit during his wrap-up of the event."But if you play into the wind over the last six holes on the Old Course there's a fair chance it will get at you, with the 17th a particularly frightening hole."
