    Graeme McDowell hopes his closing 66 at the US PGA can be the launchpad for a successful finish to the year.
    The former US Open winner was eight shots behind winner Jason Dufner in joint 12th.
    McDowell, who is looking forward to his wedding in six weeks, also gave his support to the European team at the Solheim Cup later this week.
