I'm still feeling the adrenaline right now. It feels like a release right now, but it feels really good," said Walker, who finished on 17-under 267 overall."I wasn't good enough to play golf on tour when I was at 20 or 21 like these guys are. They're really good."I've gone through everything. I played on a lot of tours, I've won on a lot of tours, and this is the final stepping stone. It feels great. I wouldn't take back anything I've ever done or anything I've ever gone through to get here."Singh recorded his best showing on the Tour since finishing runner-up at the 2011 Northern Trust Open, with his final round of 68 leaving him on 15-under-par overall.Koepka had to settle for a share of third on 14-under, with Kevin Na (64), Scott Brown (64) and Hideki Matsuyama (66).George McNeill and Brian Harman were a shot further back, while Will MacKenzie, Billy Hurley and Max Homa were tied on 12-under-par.
