Webb Simpson during the third round of the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open at TPC Summerlin.Webb Simpson remained on course for his first victory since last year's US Open as he maintained his four shot lead after the third round of the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in Las Vegas.Simpson could not replicate his fine form in the opening couple of days, which had seen him reach 15 under par overall at TPC Summerlin after rounds of 64 and 63, but a third round 67 was enough to remain well in charge.He moved on to 19-under par and that was enough to keep him four shots clear of his closest challenger, and it would appear only something spectacular will keep him from winning his first tournament since the 2012 US Open.

He holed his approach shot from 98 yards to eagle the par-five 16th to at least ensure Simpson did not strengthen his overnight position.Jeff Overton, who is yet to win on the PGA Tour, will go into the final round trailing Simpson by five shots following a bogey-free 68, which takes him to 14 under par overall.The 30-year-old made a bright start with a birdie on his opening hole and added to that by picking up shots at the fourth and 16th.Jason Bohn is a shot further back after his two under par round. The American looked on course for a stunning day after opening with three birdies in his first four holes, but he double bogeyed the sixth and his challenge did not recover.First round leader JJ Henry is among six players in a tie for fifth.Henry broke the course record on Thursday after shooting 60 but rounds of 71 and 70 has seen his challenge stagnate.He lies alongside fellow Americans Sean O'Hair - whose eight under par was the round of the day - William McGirt, Ryan Moore and J.J. Henry, and Scotland's Russell Knox on 12 under par.
