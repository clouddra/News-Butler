After taking a penalty drop back onto the fairway, McIlroy hit a wonderful fourth shot to 15ft, but missed the par putt and signed for a level-par 72.England's Tommy Fleetwood and Spain's Sergio Garcia were a shot behind on six under, with US Open champion Justin Rose and Open champion Phil Mickelson on five under.Mickelson, who took nine on his penultimate hole on Thursday in an opening 71, birdied five of his last six holes in his 68, dropping a shot on the reachable par-four 16th after hooking his tee shot into the water.Rose's water trouble came on the last, the Englishman thinning a bunker shot across the green and into the hazard on his way to a closing bogey and round of 71.
