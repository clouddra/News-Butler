    Rory McIlroy and Peter Hanson take part in a demonstration of Chinese drumming at the BMW Masters in Shanghai.

McIlroy says that his form is back where it needs to be 

     after showing glimpses of his best play at the recent Korean Open, where he finished second.
    It was McIlroy's second top-five finish of a difficult year in which he has slipped to sixth in the world rankings.
