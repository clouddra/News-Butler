Webb Simpson: Celebrates his six-stroke victory at the Shriners Hospitals for Children OpenWebb Simpson claimed his first win of 2013 in impressive fashion as he finished six shots clear at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in Las Vegas.Simpson held a comfortable four-shot lead heading into the final round, but he showed tremendous composure at TPC Summerlin to card a five-under-par 66 and seal his first success on the PGA Tour since triumphing at the US Open last year.The American made a great start to his round, pitching to 15 feet for birdies at the second and third holes.He made another birdie to enter the turn on three under for his round, but then three-putted at the 12th for his only bogey of the day, which left him just three strokes clear of compatriot Bohn.Simpson bounced back at the next hole, hitting his second shot to within a couple of feet before further birdies at the 15th and 16th helped him finish well clear of Jason Bohn and Ryo Ishikawa."It means the world. This year, I felt like I've gotten better, just hadn't got the win. We've been working hard," he said on Sky Sports.

"I knew there was a lot of pressure on me when I moved up the world rankings and I knew a lot of people start looking at you and watching you every week."I felt like I learnt to deal with it towards the end of the year and I felt a lot better mentally this year."Despite moving to within three shots of the lead with six holes left, Bohn failed to seize the initiative and his final round 66 saw him finish in a tie for second alongside Ishikawa, who never seriously threatened Simpson despite a fine six-under-par 65.Charley Hoffman finished a further shot back after carding 64, the same score as fellow Americans Luke Guthrie and Troy Matteson, who finished in a tie for fifth along with compatriots Charles Howell III Chesson Hadley.
