Rose said: "I felt like I didn't really play my best today but I kept the ball out of some really bad spots out there on the golf course."I felt like I putted really well today. I felt like I read the greens well. There's quite a bit of break. I felt like I had a lot of putts that I was playing two, three, four cups outside the hole. But for the most part, I read the greens well."Scott, like his three rivals, admitted he found the going tougher on the back nine."It was a tale of two nines," said the Aussie. "I played really nice on the front nine, then just like the other guys, had a few struggles on the back, and made the worst of it, really. Unfortunately missed a few putts and a bad break on 16."But I felt like I played pretty well. I probably should have had a couple better. Have to go out there tomorrow and light it up."
