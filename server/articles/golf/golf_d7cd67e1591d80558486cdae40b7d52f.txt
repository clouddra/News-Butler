    2012 Open champion Ernie Els says he was inspired by the "courage" shown by Seve Ballesteros in winning twice at Royal Lytham & St Annes as he 
    
won his second Claret Jug.
    The 42-year-old South Afican admits that he was "really down" last year but thanks those close to him for a return to form that saw him collect his second Open title ten years on from his last victory.
    The four-time major winner played the back nine in four under par during the week's toughest conditions to pip Australian Adam Scott by one shot.
