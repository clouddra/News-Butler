    Teenage golf sensation Charley Hull says her first Solheim Cup experience has been "wicked" following Europe's 
    
18-10 victory over the United States in Colorado.
    Hull, 17, got Europe off to a perfect start on the final day with a convincing win over Paula Creamer in the second match, defeating the American 5&4 before asking the former US Open champion to sign her ball for a friend.
    The Kettering player 
    
only turned professional in March, 

     finishing as runner-up in her first five events on tour.
