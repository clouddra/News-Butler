    Rory McIlroy claimed a share of second place at the Korea Open after a 67 in Sunday's final round.
    The Northern Irishman, who had fallen 10 shots behind the lead after three rounds, carded five birdies in his four-under-par round to end one behind winner Kang Sung-hoon.
    The only blemish for world number six McIlroy was a bogey at the 16th.
    McIlroy, the star attraction at the OneAsia Tour event, said: "I could have shot anything, absolutely anything."
    It was a strong finish after what had been a frustrating third day for the two-time major winner at the Woo Jeong Hills Country Club course near Cheonan.
    "I only missed two greens and had so many chances, but it was like the story of yesterday - I just didn't hole enough putts," added McIlroy. 
    "I created so many more chances today that it could have been 61, 62. It just wasn't to be.
    "I didn't birdie any of the par fives, which was disappointing.
    "I felt like it could have been so much lower the last couple of days."
    McIlroy was three off the pace when he completed his round but the capitulation of overnight leader Kim Hyung-tae may have exacerbated his sense of frustration.
    Kim had begun the final round with a four-stroke lead but shot a six-over 77 to finish alongside McIlroy on three under.
    Three other Koreans, Lee Sang-hee, Lee Chang-woo and Joong-kyung, also finished on three-under 281.
    Kang won the title after coming home in 32, finishing a crucial birdie at the last.
