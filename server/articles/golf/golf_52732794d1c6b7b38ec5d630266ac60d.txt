You're not happy to finish third or fourth or fifth or sixth or tenth, just play as good as you can."The tension is nothing really. Today it felt like any tournament - if I will be leading playing the last day, then maybe I'll feel the tension, but right now it's just one round out of four. It's good to at least have a chance to do it."The game is there, you just need a little bit of confidence."Pre-tournament favourite Dustin Johnson leads the chasing pack as part of an eight-man group a shot behind the leaders on three-under."I played pretty well," said Johnson, who is recovering from a slight illness. "I missed a couple short putts, but other than that, I hit it pretty well."I just have a little bit of a cough which is okay - I'm back to where I feel good enough to play good golf."Englishman Sam Little and Swede Fredrik Andersson Hed, who is also battling to keep his card, are on three-under while defending champion Bo Van Pelt started off his defence with a two-under round of 70.It was a shaky start for a few players in and around that magical 110th spot in the Race to Dubai, with Alex Levy (108th), Richard Bland (109th) and James Kingston (111th) all finishing two-over for their rounds.That will mean for a nervous second round for them, along with Peter Lawrie who was one-over for his first round and needs a big finish as he currently sits in 114th and just outside the mark for keeping his card.
