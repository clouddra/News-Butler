Tiger Woods: Five wins on the tour this yearTiger Woods would rather win a round of golf at his local course than be voted player of the year by his fellow professionals, says Sky Sports' Denis Pugh.Woods is in contention for the PGA Tour Player of the Year award, which is voted for by tour members, after winning five times on the tour this year.
    "One thing we know about Tiger is that no-one else's opinion really matters to him. It is what he wants to do."

The 37-year-old has failed to add to 14 major titles in 2013 but Pugh insists he has still enjoyed a strong year on the PGA Tour.Although, the Sky Sports expert insists Woods' obsession with winning, and disinterest in other people's opinions, means the Player of the Year title would mean nothing to Woods."He does not care. He really does not care if he wins player of the year," Pugh told Sky Sports. "It means nothing. It is not something he'd have won, it's voted for."Tiger would rather go out and win a medal at his local club. That would mean more to him than winning Player of the Year."One thing we know about Tiger is that no-one else's opinion really matters to him. It is what he wants to do."He is a winner pure and simple. And he doesn't want to win other people's votes. He is not going to try to be President, I don't think!"Whenever you have a vote there is a degree of popularity - I think he has retained it as a competitor."He is not very warm with many of the guys, maybe Steve Stricker, but there is not a great deal of warmth between Tiger and his field."Woods is still in contention for the BMW Championship - four shots off the pace - as play went into Monday after Sunday's final round was suspended due to rain.And Pugh insists the World No1's efforts this year only appear wanting when compared to his previous achievements."If he wins this week or next, that is six wins and no majors and people will say it was a bad year," he said. "It is a bad year for the standards he has set."He has also made a rod for his own back by saying that it is all about majors."To win five times, and possibly six coming up, is pretty good play; you are having a pretty good year. There is no doubt about that."
