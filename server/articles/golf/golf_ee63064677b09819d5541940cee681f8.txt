"Sixty-two, I don't know how it could ever not be fun."I figured out something on the range last night and my swing was much more comfortable today. I felt free so I could go ahead and aim at some flags. I pulled it off and made some putts."One shot back at 12 under was Jimmy Walker, who also carded a 62, tying a record he already jointly held.Alongside Walker were Vijay Singh and Robert Garrigus, while Japan's Ryo Ishikawa led a group of five on 10 under.
