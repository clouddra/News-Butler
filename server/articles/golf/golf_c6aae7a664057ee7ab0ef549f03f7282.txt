Tiger Woods: Involved in a number of rules infringements this yearTelevision commentator Brandel Chamblee has issued an apology for implying that Tiger Woods cheated on several occasions this year.The former PGA Tour professional caused a huge stir in the United States when he accused the world No 1 of being "cavalier with the rules" regarding a number of infringements.Chamblee awarded Woods an "F" grade for a season which yielded five victories, and compared cheating in a school test with a number of rules violations committed by the 14-time major champion."What brought me here was the realisation that my comments inflamed an audience on two sides of an issue," Chamblee wrote on his Twitter account.
    "Golf is a gentleman's game and I'm not proud of this debate. I want to apologise to Tiger for this incited discourse."

"Golf is a gentleman's game and I'm not proud of this debate. I want to apologise to Tiger for this incited discourse."My intention was to note Tiger's rules infractions this year, but comparing that to cheating in grade school went too far."Chamblee's originally comments related to four rules incidents involving Woods this year, most notably at The Masters when he received a two-shot penalty for an illegal drop when many felt he should have been disqualified.The Golf Channel analyst compared the incidents to when he cheated on a maths test during his school days."When I got the paper back it had '100' written at the top and just below the grade, was this quote, "Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive!" Chamblee wrote."It was an oft-quoted line from the epic poem 'Marmion' by Sir Walter Scott, and my teacher's message was clear. Written once more beneath that quote was my grade of '100', but this time with a line drawn through it and beneath that an F."I never did ask my teacher how she knew I cheated and I certainly didn't protest the grade. I knew I had done the wrong thing and my teacher the right, but I never forgot the way I felt when I read that quote."I remember when we only talked about Tiger's golf. I miss those days."He won five times and contended in majors and won the Vardon Trophy and ... how shall we say this ... was a little cavalier with the rules."Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, told ESPN.com last week that he would "have to give some thought to legal action".
