Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson: Fought back to all square in their unfinished foursomesThe USA will have a commanding five-point lead when the foursomes resume at the weather-hit Presidents Cup on Sunday.More rain delays at Muirfield Village on Saturday means the tournament is still playing catch-up despite a hectic third day which saw the USA extend their lead to 11.5-6.5.The day began with the first round of foursomes being shared 3-3 which meant the USA held a narrow 6.5-5.5 advantage.But, aided by a third straight win for Tiger Woods and Matt Kuchar, Fred Couples' men won the second set of fourballs 4-1 to pull into a 10.5-6.5 lead.That left Nick Price's underdogs with a mountain to climb going into the final round of foursomes but they set about their task with relish and early on in the matches which didn't get under way until late afternoon they were up in all five.However, the only match to finish went the way of the USA after Zach Johnson holed out from the fairway for eagle at the 15th to complete a 4&3 victory with Jason Dufner over the International pairing of Richard Sterne and Marc Leishman.Johnson and Dufner had been 2 down after six but after the seventh was halved the American duo won six of the next eight holes to take victory.The remaining four matches will resume on Sunday morning (7.35am local time, 12.35pm UK) with the Internationals up in two, the US up in one and the other match all square.Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel are 3up on Webb Simpson and Brandt Snedeker after 12 while Ernie Els and Brendon de Jonge are 2up on Woods and Kuchar after nine.Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson, who played some sparkling golf to win their fourballs against Els and de Jonge, were three down after just five holes against Jason Day and Graham DeLaet but they'll resume all square on Sunday morning after winning 8, 11 and 13 to pull level with five to play.In the other match, Bill Haas and Stricker are 2up on Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama after 10.If the weather behaves - and the forecast doesn't look great - the 12 singles matches are due to start around 9am local time (1pm BST).
