Suzann Pettersen: Strong start in Taiwan for the defending championDefending champion Suzann Pettersen has grabbed the early lead at the LPGA's Sunrise Championship in Taiwan.The Norwegian's opening four-under-par 68 included six birdies in 11 holes from the fifth, offset by a brace of bogeys.Pettersen was the only player to break 70 and goes into Friday's second round with a three-stroke advantage over four players.Her nearest challengers are Americans Alison Walshe and Irene Cho, Caroline Hedwall of Sweden and French pro Karine Icher.Hedwall had a particularly topsy-turvy round that yielded five birdies and four bogeys.Pettersen is hoping to close the gap on South Korean Inbee Park at the top of the LPGA rankings.Park is not participating this week at Yang Mei where Catriona Matthew is the leading Brit after 18 holes.The experienced Scot is seven shots off the pace in a tie-for-35th, as she ruined her day with bogeys at each of the last two holes.Pettersen said: "It was a tough day out there, conditions were not great."I've played this course in nicer conditions. Once the rain stopped, the wind picked up, so I mean, it's your pick, if you want rain or you want wind."I don't really feel comfortable around this place because the wind is all over but I feel pretty good with my game."I feel my ball-striking is pretty much where I want it to be."I've got to just be very clear on what I'm trying to do and step up and do it."
