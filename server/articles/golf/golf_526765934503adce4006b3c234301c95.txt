    BBC Sport looks back at Nick Faldo's two wins in the Open at Muirfield in 1987 and 1992.
    The Englishman is coming out of semi-retirement this week to play in the 2013 tournament and

    Faldo has six majors to his name, winning the 1990 Open at St Andrews, as well as three victories at the Masters in 1989, 1990, and 1996.
