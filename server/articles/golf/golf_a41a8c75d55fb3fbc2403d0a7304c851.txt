I had played play-offs in mini tour events, but playing with Ross Fisher, he's one of my heroes. Playing with him in the play-off, it was unbelievable."Fisher added: "Obviously it would have been lovely to have come here and won, but that's golf."Unfortunately I came up a little bit short, but I can be very pleased the way I played today. I hung in there really well; it was always going to be tough."Hats off to Jin for winning his first professional tournament."
