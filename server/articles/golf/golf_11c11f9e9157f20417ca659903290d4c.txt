    Craig Lawrie, son of 1999 Open champion Paul, has followed in his father's footsteps by turning professional.
    The 18-year-old Scot will make his debut in the North-East Alliance tournament, which starts on Thursday in Ellon, near his Aberdeen home.
    Lawrie said on Twitter: "My wee loon @CraigLawrie95 has turned pro this morning. All the best pal."
    His eldest son will be attached to the Paul Lawrie Golf Centre and will represent the Aberdeen facility.
Paul thinks Craig is a better player than he was at 18
