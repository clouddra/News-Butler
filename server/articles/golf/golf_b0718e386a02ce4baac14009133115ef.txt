YANGMEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Paced by a hole-in-one, defending champion Suzann Pettersen shot a 3-under 69 Friday to take a five-stroke lead after the second round at the Sunrise Championship.Pettersen's ace on the second hole helped her finish at 7 under after 36 holes, comfortably ahead of Sun Young Yoo and Carlota Ciganda at 2 under.Pettersen is chasing Ingbee Park at the top of the LPGA rankings.While the 32-year-old Norwegian cannot overhaul her South Korean rival this week, a Sunrise win would close the gap. Park is not competing in the Taiwan event.
