Tim Finchem: PGA Tour commissioner announces new Chinese ventureThe PGA Tour has announced it will be a partner in a new developmental tour in China next year which will feature 12 tournaments.The China Tour-PGA Tour China Series is scheduled to start in March with prize funds for each tournament around $200,000, with events not just restricted to home players.They are already involved in partner agreements with two other tours in Canada and Latin America, both of which provide access to the second-tier Web.com Tour in America for their leading players."We are very pleased to announce the establishment of PGA Tour China, which builds upon our longstanding relationship with the China Golf Association," PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said."PGA Tour China will provide open competition on a quality tour for elite players from China and other countries and the opportunity to advance to the world stage."We plan to provide access to the Web.com Tour for the season's top players."We don't see any effect on either OneAsia or the European Tour's interests in co-sanctioning events in certain places."Matter of fact, if we're just talking about China, the extent to which they accelerate those things would be a positive. It is an avenue for elite player participation."The European Tour currently stages three events in China, including this week's WGC-HSBC Champions event where the announcement was made.Earlier this year Finchem had to deny reports the PGA Tour had made an offer to buy the European Tour amid rumoured talk about establishing a lucrative worldwide tour.
