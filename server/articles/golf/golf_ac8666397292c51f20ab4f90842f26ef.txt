Masters champion Adam Scott 

     fired a course-record 64 to claim victory at the PGA Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda.

US Open winner 

     Justin Rose had 
    
a two-shot lead  

    after the first round and was still ahead with three holes to play.
    But Rose, 33, bogeyed the 16th in carding a 69 while Scott, also 33, eagled the 17th to win by two shots.

US PGA champion Jason Dufner 

     finished five shots behind Scott with Padraig Harrington, playing in place of Phil Mickelson, another six strokes back.
    The 36-hole exhibition is for the year's four major winners, but 
    
Open champion Mickelson 

     opted not to compete.
    Irishman Harrington won the event last year after stepping in for Ernie Els.
