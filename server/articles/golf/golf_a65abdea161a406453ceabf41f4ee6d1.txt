    As Sebastian Vettel clinches a fourth consecutive world title, BBC Sport takes a look at some of the other men and women who have dominated their sports.
    We feature a multitude of multiple winners including Usain Bolt, Martina Navratilova, Ed Moses, Manchester United, the Spanish football team and other champions from snooker, golf, motorsport, darts and athletics.
    After claiming another F1 crown, Vettel admitted he had been 
    
hurt by the boos he received on the podium at several races this season, 

     and said he thought the reaction was coming from people who did not want to see one team and driver winning so much.
