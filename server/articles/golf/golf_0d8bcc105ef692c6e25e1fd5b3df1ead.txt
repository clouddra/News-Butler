Charley Hull: Seeking maiden LET success in ChinaSolheim Cup heroine Charley Hull is hoping to claim her maiden victory on the Ladies European Tour in China this weekend.The 17-year-old rookie, who started the season with five successive second place finishes, will tee up in the three-round Suzhou Taihu Ladies Open starting on Friday at Suzhou Taihu International Golf Club in a field of 114 international competitors from the LET, China LPGA and Ladies Asian Golf Tour."Obviously I'd like to get a win under my belt, or just another good finish," said the Woburn player, who is ranked ninth on the LET order of merit after 12 tournaments so far this season.Hull believes she will have a better chance of success this week after finishing in a tie for 35th place at the Sanya Ladies Open last week in tropical Hainan, on her first visit to China."I played quite well last week but the putts didn't drop for me in the last couple of rounds. It was a bit frustrating because I started off quite well with a five-under, but it's all a learning experience for next year," she added."I think the greens are a lot better from last week because this week they are rolling nicely, with no grain and they are pretty pure."I think I've got as good a chance as any week if I just keep patient and as its getting towards the end of the season I'm starting to work on a lot of stuff for next year, because you don't get to work on it so I'm using these last few tournaments to prepare myself for next year."
