Amy Yang: Play-off winner in KoreaAmy Yang birdied the first play-off hole to beat South Korean compatriot Hee Kyung Seo and win the KEB HanaBank Championship.Yang's birdie putt on the par-five closing hole at the Ocean Course in Incheon ensured the belated first victory of her career on the LPGA Tour.She eagled the par-four 15th in regulation play and added two further birdies in a round of 69 that included only one bogey.Seo eagled the par-four 11th and had four further birdies in a closing 68 which left both players on seven-under and in control as the overnight leaders fell apart.Sweden's Anna Nordqvist could only manage a 75 and dropped down to eighth but that was much better than Katherine Hull-Kirk, who carded seven bogeys in a round of 80.Defending champion Suzann Pettersen (70) finished in a tie for third with a hard-charging Michelle Wie, who finished with a day's best 66 to jump 19 places, and another Korean Sei Young-Kim (69).
