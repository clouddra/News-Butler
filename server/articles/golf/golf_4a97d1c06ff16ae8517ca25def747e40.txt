Dustin Johnson: Confident of doing well at Lake KarrinyupDustin Johnson hopes to keep the trophy in American hands when he tees it up in this week's Perth International in Australia.Twelve months ago on the same Lake Karrinyup course, Bo Van Pelt took the title after a final day battle with another US colleague Jason Dufner.Van Pelt is back to defend (Dufner is absent) but it's Johnson who the bookmakers have installed as tournament favourite (13/2 at Sky Bet) to win the co-sanctioned European Tour event."I think around here if the putter is rolling good, then I'm going to have a good chance to win," said Johnson. "It's a golf course I think suits my eye pretty well, and there's a lot of birdies to be made out there."

The world no 21 has had to deal with a bout of illness in the build-up but doesn't think it will be a problem."I feel a lot better today," he said on Wednesday. "I think it's just a head cold. It's not too bad, hopefully starting to feel probably 70 per cent today, so hopefully tomorrow I'll feel a lot better. I think I just got something on the plane on the way over."I got a good bit of rest last night and definitely feeling better as the day goes on. Hopefully tomorrow be back to 100 per cent.This is Johnson's debut at Lake Karrinyup but he's impressed by what he sees."The course is in great shape. The greens are tough; they are really fast and a lot of undulations. So it's tough to get the ball close to the hole."You've got to hit some really good tee shots, and then you've got to be really spot on with your irons coming into the greens. The par fives are pretty reachable and there's a few short holes where you can make a lot of birdies."I didn't really get to practice the last few days, but I was fairly pleased with it today."
