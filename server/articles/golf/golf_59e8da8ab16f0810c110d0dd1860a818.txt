Brett Rumford with joint course record in PerthBrett Rumford shot a course record-equalling 65 to fly up the leaderboard at the ISPS Handa Perth International and sit just a shot behind fellow local and third round leader Brody Ninyette.The home crowds have plenty to shout about with two Western Australian's fighting it out at the top of the standings - with Ninyette shooting 67 in the wind and the rain at Lake Karrinyup Country Club to move to eight-under.That put him one shot clear of the three-man tie for second with Rumford joining Denmark's JB Hansen (66) and South Korean former World Amateur Number One Jin Jeong (69).

"It was very blustery. We had some really heavy downpours, which made, at times, made the golf course very, very tough."I guess today was just a credit to myself. I feel as though maybe the last two or three years, my maturity in the game and out on the golf course has really stepped up and that showed today."If I were to win here, it would be the crème de la crème - winning in front of your home crowd, there would be nothing better than that, that's for sure."Ninyette, meanwhile, is hoping to spoil Rumford's party to secure what would be a life-changing victory and a two-year exemption on The European Tour."Being able to play in Europe next year would be massive," said the 26 year old. "It would be amazing.  It would be a whole new experience, getting out there and playing over there would be unreal to see how the world's best do it."While the battle for the Perth International will take centre stage on Sunday, the fight to see which players can keep their playing rights for 2014 will enter the final round with many of the players in need of a huge finish on the upper echelons of the leaderboard.Richard Finch and Fredrik Andersson Hed are among those players tied for fifth place on six under (along with Ross Fisher) and need to finish fourth and third respectively to survive, while Joel Sjoholm, who needs second place or better, is just a one stroke further back alongside Tour winners Michael Hoey and Danny Willet.Despite a disappointing third round 75 which saw him fall back to four under, second round leader Peter Hedblom is not quite dead yet.The Swede, who needs to win to keep his tour card, will need to produce the performance of a lifetime to claim the ultimate prize, while Oliver Fisher, currently tied 17th on three under needs to finish in the top seven to succeed.Australian duo David McKenzie and Rohan Blizard produced the shots of the day as both scored holes-in-one.Blizard holed out on the par-three 17th before McKenzie aced the par three eighth.McKenzie finished the day on two-under while Blizard signed off at even-par.
