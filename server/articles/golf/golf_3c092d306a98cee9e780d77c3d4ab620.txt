    As BBC Sport celebrates 60 years of Sports Personality of the Year, we visit the archives to remember the achievements of all the previous winners.
    In 1957, golfer Dai Rees was named winner of Sports Review of the Year.
    Welshman Rees became a national celebrity as he guided the 1957 European team to Ryder Cup glory at the Lindrick Golf Club in Yorkshire, their first win over the United States since 1933.
