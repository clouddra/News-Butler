Lee Westwood: Won two of the last four events to win Order of Merit in 2009Lee Westwood is determined to make another late challenge for the Race to Dubai crown as he prepares for the European Tour's Finals Series.The Englishman tees up alongside a star-studded field at this week's BMW Masters in Shanghai still believing he can top the European Tour Money List despite spending most of the season on the PGA Tour.The 40-year-old won two of the final four events of the 2009 season to clinch his second Order of Merit title, and he remains confident that a third is not beyond his reach.Westwood is currently 18th in the Race to Dubai standings and over one million euros behind leader Henrik Stenson, who is also in the field in China longside the likes of Rory McIlroy, Martin Kaymer and Luke Donald.But he could have been much higher in the standings had he converted 54-hole leads at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in May and the Open Championship at Muirfield in July."I have only played nine times on the European Tour this year and I haven't won. I haven't finished better than third," said Westwood."Not winning The Open was a disappointment but not winning the PGA Championship was the biggest disappointment. I had a great chance there and just hit a couple of bad shots coming in."But I still have a chance to win the money list, and that's something to strive for."I had a strong finish in 2009 when I last won it, you know, winning two out of the last four."It's possible if you win a couple of these events to make a lot of ground up."
