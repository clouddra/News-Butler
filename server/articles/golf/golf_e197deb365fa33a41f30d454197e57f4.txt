    "He was out of line and something should be done about it (by) the Golf Channel, that's who Brandel is employed by and they are the ones that can deal with it."

Woods has threatened to sue Chamblee over his remarks and McIlroy has defended the American by urging the Golf Channel to take action against the pundit."He was out of line and something should be done about it (by) the Golf Channel, that's who Brandel is employed by and they are the ones that can deal with it," said the Northern Irishman after taking the first-round lead at the WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai."I'll let the Golf Channel executives think what the right way is," added McIlroy, referring to Chamblee's full-time employer although the comments were made on golf.com which is not affiliated to the TV network.Former PGA Tour winner Chamblee, who has been an outspoken critic of Woods' swing, has already announced he will stop his golf.com column at the end of the year and instead write only for golfchannel.com.
