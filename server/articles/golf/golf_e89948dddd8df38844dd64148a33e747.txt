Jaidee, Casey and Lee all fired 70s for the second straight day, Lee holing his second from 188 yards at the tough par four 16th for an unlikely eagle.Former world number one Rory McIlroy, still seeking his first win in 2013 after five victories last year, had moved to three under with birdies at the third and seventh but lost momentum after that and finished at one-under after a round of level par 72.He's now in tied 12th alongside Ryder Cup teammates Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter.Poulter produced a back nine charge with four birdies in six holes from the 10th but was hurt by bogeys at 16 and 18.Daly, who had been Guthrie's nearest challenger after a bogey-free 68 in round one, carded a 74 to slip to tied ninth. After a low-key first 12 holes he finished birdie-bogey-birdie-double bogey-birdie-bogey to end the day at two-under.Meanwhile, Graeme McDowell's hopes of eating into Henrik Stenson's Race To Dubai lead took a blow after a poor finish.Second-placed McDowell currently lies 425,573 euros (£362,660) behind the Swede, but with a first prize of 850,000 euros (£725,000) on offer here and a total prize fund of almost £20million in the four events of the inaugural Final Series, the battle to become European number one in Dubai in mid-November is far from over.FedEx Cup winner Stenson dropped down the field to 28th after a second round 74 left him at two-over but, after looking nicely placed, 2010 US Open champion McDowell dropped three shots in his last five holes to card a 74 of his own.That left McDowell at even par and in a tie for 19th.
