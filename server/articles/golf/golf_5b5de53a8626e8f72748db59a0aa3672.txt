I took a long time to get settled over it and then just didn't make a very good swing."It was tough, some of the pin positions out there today were brutal, just cut on slopes and very hard to get close to them and when you did get close to them you left yourself very tricky putts."I felt I was a little rusty after the four weeks off, but I battled back nicely and to end up under par for the day wasn't too bad."Home golfers dominated the top of the standings, with South Korean Ik-jae Jang in the lead after a four-under round of 67 which included an eagle two at the par-four 10th.Three of the four men tied for second place were also local players, with American Eric Mina the only interloper on three-under. Defending champion Kim Dae-sub was one shot further back.Scottish veteran Simon Yates ended the day alongside McIlroy on one-under, although his round would have been much better if it were not for consecutive bogeys at nine and 10.
