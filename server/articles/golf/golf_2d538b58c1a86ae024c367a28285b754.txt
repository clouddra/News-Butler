Rory McIlroy: Struggled on the greensRory McIlroy dropped out of contention at the Kolon Korea Open with a disappointing 75 in the third round of his return to competitive golf, as Kim Hyung-tae opened up a four-shot lead.Former World No 1 McIlroy is the star attraction at the Woo Jeong Hills Country Club near Seoul, and he was well in contention until his third round 75 saw him slide down the leaderboard.The two-time major winner is back in action after a month-long break and was looking to get his Asian swing off to a flying start, but just one birdie against three bogeys and one double.As a result, McIlroy slipped from a tie for fifth into a tie for 13th on one-over par, and a full ten shots behind the third round leader.Mclroy reached the turn level for his round with just a birdie and a bogey, having missed a number of birdies chances, and he would rue those misses on the back nine after a double bogey on the par-4 10th, and a bogey on the par-4 11th before his final dropped shot on the 15th.Kim shot to the top of the leaderboard with a flawless round of 66 putting him on nine-under and into a commanding four shot to take into Sunday's final round.Hong Soon-sang held the overnight lead, but after a solid front nine he dropped three shots on the back nine to slip down into second place on his own on five-under.McIlroy said later he would try to go low in Sunday's final round."Last time here (in 2011) I shot 64 in the last round so it would need something probably similar or a little better to have a chance," he said."A frustrating day, because I was in contention after two days and if you shoot a solid score today you're right in there. I've just got to go out there tomorrow and shoot the best score that I can."I just think the story of the day is that I missed a lot of putts, missed a lot of chances for birdies at the start of the round and then missed a few short ones for pars in the middle and end of the round. That's really what it was."It's a struggle, especially where they've put some of the pin positions. It's tough to get yourself to commit to a certain line because you'll hit a few and they'll go through the break, and some turn more than others. It's just tough to commit to the line you choose.The world number six is still winless since changing club manufacturer earlier this year but he's trying to stay upbeat."I wanted to come here and play; it's nothing about trying to build confidence or anything like that. I guess more than anything else I wanted to shake the rust off this week and try and get into contention - and obviously try to win."
