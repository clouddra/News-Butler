Scott: Got his hands on the trophy after rivals fell awayA number of contenders will be kicking themselves after seeing Adam Scott snatch victory at The Barclays, says Mark Roe.The Masters winner struck a fine 66 on the final day to finish one clear on 11 under par, but having begun the day six shots off the lead was somewhat a surprise winner of the opening FedEx Cup play-off.
    "When Adam Scott finished he clearly didn't think he could win the tournament."

And Roe believes the likes of Tiger Woods, Justin Rose, Gary Woodland and Graham DeLaet, who all finished on ten under, will walk away from Liberty National in New Jersey with regrets."Apart from Adam Scott, every other player that was in contention going into that final round has got to be sat in the locker room asking themselves the question: 'why?'" said Roe."There were so many bizarre clubs and so many strange choices. Phil Mickelson [who finished nine under] had a chance early on to post a score of -11 - why didn't he hit a driver at 16?"Kevin Chappell was still in the tournament at the 16th tee and hit a fat iron when he could have reached the green with a driver..."There were so many things to look at and go 'I can't believe what I'm seeing' and you could tell by Adam Scott's reaction on the practice ground when they told him he'd won he was thinking 'how did that happen?' because when he finished he clearly didn't think he could win the tournament."Denis Pugh was equally astonished by the course management of the top players chasing victory and concluded this year's event will be remembered for some time to come.

"Adam finished and then everyone just seemed to take crazy gas," he joked."I don't know if there were toxic fumes coming out of the place or what but it seemed that every single decision was the wrong one!"If they played aggressively it should have been safe, if they played safe they should have been aggressive."Tiger hit one of the worst shots we've ever seen and collapsed in a heap and then came back and played fantastic - it really did have everything. It will be memorable, alright."Woods' back spasms, which forced the world number one to his knees on the 13th, were a major talking point of Sunday's play, although his participation at next week's Deutsche Bank Championship in Boston is not thought to be in doubt."He's box office in every way," said Roe."When he hit the second shot into the par five and collapsed in a heap I actually thought he might have to go in and call it a day because he looked in so much pain."You've got to think 'he can't carry on'. If you're in that much pain hitting a full shot what have you got left? It seemed to me it was the fade shots the whole time that hurt his back. The draw seemed to be more comfortable."
