(Reuters) - Former world number one amateur Jin Jeong beat England's Ross Fisher in a play-off for his maiden professional title at the Perth International on Sunday. The 23-year-old South Korean calmly sunk his putt after Fisher missed a four-meter effort for par on the 18th, the first playoff hole, to win the $2 million event, co-sanctioned by the European Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia. Trailing overnight leader Brody Ninyette by a stroke, Jin got off to a nightmarish start with a double bogey on the par-four first hole but kept his composure to gain five strokes to finish tied with Fisher on 10-under for the tournament. The victory will give Jin a two-year exemption on the Tour. (Writing by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Patrick Johnston)
