David Lynn kisses the trophy after his one-shot winNew Portugal Masters champion David Lynn said it was a "great feeling" to get his hands on some silverware again.The Englishman had gone 223 starts without a victory on the European Tour before posting a closing 63 at the Oceanico Victoria Golf Course to claim a one-shot win from South African Justin Walters.Lynn, who struggled to a 73 on Saturday, said: "I was really disappointed when I walked off the course yesterday, I just didn't hole any putts and made seven at 17 and thought maybe I had played myself out of it."Today was just a case of I've got to go out there and make as many birdies as I can. I must admit I was thinking of Scott Jamieson's 60 (in the third round). If I could do something like that, who knows? The wind was up quite a bit today so eight under is a really good score.

"I really caught fire on the front nine, I was making everything I looked at, although I hit it to one foot at the first which got me off to a really good start. After that I made a couple of great putts for par to keep the momentum going and then I was making the birdie putts."Lynn - who began the week 52nd in the world rankings - held a two-shot lead playing the last but admitted it was a "heart in mouth moment" when his approach looked set to find the water short of the green.It ended up clearing the hazard by a matter of feet and two putts later he had completed what proved to be the winning round and his first European Tour win since his only previous success at the KLM Open in 2004.After hoisting aloft the trophy, he added: "It's your dream to win. That's what we're out here for. It's a great feeling to know I can do it again."There was a flood of emotions for runner-up Walters, who secured his card just two weeks after the death of his mother.Walters looked certain to drop a shot on the last after finding a fairway bunker with his tee shot, but holed a massive par putt and punched the air in delight before the tears began to flow."I don't know if I can talk much right now," the 32-year-old from Johannesburg said. "Coming into the week I really didn't have any goals or ambitions, I just wanted to play and honour my mum and make her proud."The putts kept dropping and I kept hitting some decent shots and the last one at the end, she made it for sure. It was probably the best moment of my career. It was so cool because I had a lot on the line."I hadn't looked at a leaderboard all day so didn't know where I stood in terms of keeping my card and for it to go in on the last, all the emotions hit me."I don't think I have the words for it just yet. Maybe after a drink with my dad who is here with me we can fully take it all in, but at first glance I don't know how I did it. I am super proud and so happy I could honour my mum. That feels the best for me right now."
