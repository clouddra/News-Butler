Paul McGinley: Wants to avoid clash with FedEx Cup event in BostonEuropean captain Paul McGinley has confirmed he will announce his wild card picks for next year's Ryder Cup a day later than scheduled.The Irishman was originally due to unveil his three captain's selections on Monday, September 2, the day after the final qualifying event - the Italian Open - finishes.But he has put back the announcement by 24 hours to avoid clashing with the Deutsche Bank Championship, the second of the four FedEx Cup play-off events, which will finish on the Monday.The delay will also avoid a repeat of the situation in 2010, when Justin Rose and Paul Casey played the final round in Boston shortly after finding out they had been overlooked by Colin Montgomerie for the contest at Celtic Manor.
    "Realistically, I think it will have minimal effect, but out of respect for any players involved, I want to allow them to finish that tournament before I call them with news, one way or another."

"With no actual qualification points counting in the Deutsche Bank Championship, I was initially prepared to make my wild card announcement on the Monday - the day after the final counting event, the 2014 Italian Open," McGinley said."But I have had a rethink and I now want to delay 24 hours as I realise that some potential members of the team might well be playing in Boston that week."Realistically, I think it will have minimal effect, but out of respect for any players involved, I want to allow them to finish that tournament before I call them with news, one way or another."The decision means both teams will announce their wild cards on the same day, with American captain Tom Watson revealing his three selections at a venue yet to be announced.McGinley will reveal his choices at the European Tour headquarters at Wentworth, which was also the venue when Gleneagles was named as the host venue in 2001.
