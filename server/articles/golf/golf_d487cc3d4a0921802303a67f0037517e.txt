Very good shot."It's nice to get a hole-in-one when you actually call the shot in advance and then pull the trigger."Spain's Carlota Ciganda and South Korea's Yoo Sun-young-are Pettersen's nearest challengers on two under, Yoo's 69 meaning she and Pettersen were the only players to break 70.Ciganda carded five birdies in her 70, but also bogeyed the 11th and ran up a double-bogey seven on the par-five 13th.Australia's Katherine Hull-Kirk and Spain's Beatriz Recari were the only other players under par after rounds of 70 and 71 respectively.
