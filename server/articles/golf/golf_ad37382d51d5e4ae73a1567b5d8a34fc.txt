    Where do we start after the abundance of headlines generated while the golfing world was in China over the last fortnight?
    The inexplicable 
    
actions of Simon Dyson that led to his BMW Masters disqualification? 

     Tiger Woods' 
    
snub of the HSBC Champions

Tiger Woods did not compete in the WGC HSBC Champions tournament
