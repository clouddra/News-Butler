Bo Van Pelt: Looking to defend his Perth International title in AustraliaAmerican Bo Van Pelt admits he will feed off positive memories as he prepares to defend his Perth International title in Australia this week.The 38-year-old held off compatriot Jason Dufner to clinch a two-stroke victory in the inaugural event last year as he enjoyed a memorable season that yielded no fewer than 12 top-10 finishes.Van Pelt has not been as prolific this time around and, having failed to qualify for the last two rounds of the FedEx Cup play-offs, has not been involved in competitive action for over a month.But he believes the return to a happy hunting ground will inspire him, telling the PGA Tour of Australasia's website: "Last year when I first played the golf course, I really enjoyed it."Jason and I had a good little battle on Sunday. I felt fortunate to come out on top."I was excited to come back to a golf course that I have those good memories at. Hopefully I'll be ready to go by Thursday. I've had five or six weeks off, so I'm kind of itching to get playing golf again."Van Pelt headlines a field with several big names in it, including compatriot Dustin Johnson, Presidents Cup debutant Branden Grace and home hero Brett Rumford.The Indiana native admitted he would have to play some of his best golf of the season if he is to retain his crown, adding: "There are a lot of good players that are playing here."Brett's obviously played well. Branden Grace just played The Presidents Cup; Dustin Johnson is one of the best players in the world."That doesn't even go into all the other guys that are in this field. Whoever wins this week is going to have to play really well."
