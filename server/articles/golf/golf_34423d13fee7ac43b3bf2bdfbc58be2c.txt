Gwladys Nocera: Chinese success for FrenchwomanGwladys Nocera produced a storming finish to win the Suzhou Taihu Ladies Open title in China.The 38-year-old Frenchwoman birdied five of the last six holes - including the 16th, 17th and 18th - on a windy and overcast final day at Suzhou Taihu International Golf Club to card a seven-under-par 65.Nocera's 54-hole total of 15-under 201 put her two shots clear of defending champion Carlota Ciganda of Spain and gave her a 12th Ladies European Tour victory.Ciganda closed with a 68, while 17-year-old Chinese amateur Jing Yan had a 67 to end on 12 under par in solo third place.Joanna Klatten of France ended up in fourth place on 11 under after a final round of 64, with England's Charley Hull (70) and Patcharajutar Kongkrapan of Thailand (68) a stroke back in a tie for fifth place.Nocera said the win made amends for the disappointment of 2009, when she finished second, a stroke behind Korea's Bo Mi Suh, after being penalised two strokes for reporting late to the tee."I finished second with a stroke penalty so I didn't feel like I deserved it and I knew I had revenge to take. It took me a while but I have my revenge and it's nice," said Nocera, who won the Allianz Ladies Slovak Open in June.
