"I really didn't play very well at all in stretches. I played well a couple of times, played well enough to keep my card, thank goodness."It was just really tough with the year being so short. I feel a bit more freed up this year."Jason Kokrak headed a group of six men on four under, alongside among others South Korea's Charlie Wi, the only non-American in the top nine.Defending champion Jonas Blixt of Sweden was two under, in a big group which also included Vijay Singh and Davis Love III, with England's Brian Davis a shot behind them on one under.
