    US Captain Meg Mallon says she is unhappy after an error by officials changed the 'momentum' of the tournament and 
    
resulted in her team falling 5-3 behind Europe.
    The key moment came at the 15th when Spaniard Carlota Ciganda benefited from a wrong ruling after her second shot found a hazard. 
    After a lengthy discussion between officials, she was allowed to take her fourth shot from a long way behind the correct spot. Mallon complained that it was the duration of the delay that affected all her players.
