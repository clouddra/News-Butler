He's had a lot of things going on this year."He hasn't played as well as he has in prior years, but he's still ranked pretty high. I think he's either fifth or sixth in the world.  A lot of guys don't even get that high."I think give him a little bit more time, I think he's starting to put the pieces together, starting to play a little bit more."He showed some really good signs towards the end of the season that the things he's working on are starting to come together."McIlroy is about to embark on a six-week tournament stretch that starts with this week's Kolon Korea Open and ends with Woods' World Challenge at Sherwood Country Club in California (December 5-8).

His only other event in 2013 will be the Turkish Airlines Open in November.Of his 2013 campaign, Woods reflected: "To have a five‑win season, I've done some pretty positive things to accomplish that."As far as some of the things I'd like to get better at, that's obviously peaking at the right times and getting the four big events (majors) next year that I'd like to win. Hopefully I can do that."Woods hasn't added to his tally of majors since banking his 14th when winning the 2008 US Open at Torry Pines.
