Tai Woffinden: Ready for surgery on his broken collarboneWorld Speedway champion Tai Woffinden will have surgery on Wednesday to start his recovery from a badly broken collarbone.Woffinden crashed twice on his way to glory, racing through the pain barrier to realise his dream and he has been told he must have the operation to allow himself maximum time for a winter training programme in the build-up to the defence of his title.He said: "I'm having the operation next Wednesday in Derby. I will have the bent plate taken out and then the surgeon will decide how best to repair the damage."It's regrettable that I will miss the Elite League Riders' Championship at Swindon next weekend, which means I won't get the chance to represent Wolverhampton and I sincerely apologise to supporters for that. I hope everyone has a great meeting."I can confirm I will be at Wolverhampton for their Banks's Olympique individual meeting on Tuesday, October 22 and I look forward to seeing all the fans at Monmore Green that night, although this will be in a non-riding capacity."Meanwhile, back on the track, Somerset produced a remarkable turnaround in the closing races of their play-off clash with Newcastle to secure a 51-39 win.The Diamonds led 34-32 on the night with just four heats to go, but the Rebels then scored three 5-1s and a 4-2, with late-season signing Charles Wright the hero with paid-14. The sides meet again at Brough Park on Sunday.Somerset boss Garry May said: "It was certainly tough, but then Newcastle are a quality side as their third place finish in the Premier League proved. We were on the rack for the majority of the meeting, but I knew we would come good in those final few heats and so it proved, with Charles putting in an exceptional shift for us from reserve."Newcastle manager George English said: "While a lot of people may well have written us off we held this match well throughout and kept the scores tight, but the last few races proved to be our downfall which was devastating."
