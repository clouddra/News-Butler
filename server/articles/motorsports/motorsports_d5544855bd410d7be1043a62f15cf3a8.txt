Chris Holder: Handed GP wild cardAs expected former world champions Chris Holder and Tomasz Gollob have both been named as two of the four permanent wild cards in the 2014 speedway Grand Prix series.Holder missed most of the season due to a serious crash at Coventry as he suffered a fractured hip, broken pelvis, shattered heel and a broken shoulder.Gollob's season was also brought to a premature end when he fractured vertebrae at the Scandinavian GP.But both have been given routes straight back into the series, along with Swedish duo Andreas Jonsson and Fredrik Lindgren - which means Sweden do have representation in the series, which was under threat.The line-up for the 2014 field is now finalised and making his debut in the 2014 World Championship is German star Martin Smolinski, who finished fourth in the GP Challenge at Poole on August 24.With the winner of the qualifying event, Niels-Kristian Iversen, finishing third in the SGP standings this year, Smolinski has been promoted into the series as one of the three qualifiers.Kasprzak finished second in the Challenge to retain his SGP spot, and Danish star Kenneth Bjerre returns after a year's absence, having finished third at Wimborne Road.World champion Tai Woffinden heads the list of automatic qualifiers for 2014. He is joined by runner-up Jaroslaw Hampel, Iversen, Greg Hancock, Nicki Pedersen, Emil Sayfutdinov, Matej Zagar and Darcy Ward.Team Great Britain skipper Chris Harris is first reserve for next year's series after finishing fifth in the GP Challenge.Troy Batchelor and Michael Jepsen Jensen will also serve as qualified substitutes. They will be drafted in if any of the regular 15 SGP riders are forced to miss a round through injury, illness or other reasons.FULL 2014 FIM SPEEDWAY GRAND PRIX SERIES LINE-UP:1 Tai Woffinden (Great Britain)2 Jaroslaw Hampel (Poland)3 Niels-Kristian Iversen (Denmark)4 Greg Hancock (USA)5 Nicki Pedersen (Denmark)6 Emil Sayfutdinov (Russia)7 Matej Zagar (Slovenia)8 Darcy Ward (Australia)9 Tomasz Gollob (Poland)10 Krzysztof Kasprzak (Poland)11 Fredrik Lindgren (Sweden)12 Chris Holder (Australia)13 Andreas Jonsson (Sweden)14 Kenneth Bjerre (Denmark)15 Martin Smolinski (Germany)16 WILD CARD17 FIRST TRACK RESERVE18 SECOND TRACK RESERVEQUALIFIED SUBSTITUTES19 Chris Harris (Great Britain)20 Troy Batchelor (Australia)21 Michael Jepsen Jensen (Denmark)Should any more riders be required as substitutes during the 2014 season, the SGP Commission will nominate the rider.
