Could Jenson Button finish his F1 career at McLaren?Jenson Button will be given the chance to finish his Formula 1 career with McLaren according to reports.The former World Champion joined the Woking-based team in 2010 and the Daily Mail claim they want to retain the British driver for another three seasons.Although not officially confirmed, Button's one-year extension for 2014 has already been sealed, but McLaren are also now looking to the longer term.'The team are already planning for 2015 and are ready to offer Button the chance of up to three more seasons as they strive to build a partnership with Honda which can rekindle the kind of success they enjoyed when Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost were behind the wheel,' the newspaper reported.Button's connections with Honda can be traced back to 2003 when he drove for the BAR team who were powered by the Japanese marque, before the team were became a fully-fledged works outfit in 2006.However, according to the Daily Mirror, the 33-year-old may not be around for Honda's return to F1 and is a potential target for Red Bull, Ferrari, Lotus and Mercedes into 2015.'Sources at Red Bull and Ferrari admit the Brit is on their wanted list, while at the end of next year all the top teams will be in a state of flux over their driver line-up,' the newspaper claims.'Red Bull are waiting to see how new boy Daniel Ricciardo performs. And Ferrari have cast an eye over Button yet again because they are by no means certain the Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso partnership will make a second season.'Lotus rate him highly too and Lewis Hamilton would certainly work with him again at Mercedes.'Whether Alonso's potential partnership with Raikkonen even makes one season is still the subject of much speculation with fresh rumours in the Japanese paddock that McLaren are still looking at luring the double World Champion back to the team in place of Sergio Perez.
