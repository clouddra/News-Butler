Dani Sordo: Secured maiden WRC triumph at Rally of GermanyDani Sordo secured his maiden WRC victory after a hard-fought battle with Thierry Neuville at the Rally of Germany.The race itself had already been overshadowed by an appalling tragedy on Saturday's final stage when two Dutch competitors taking part in a support race were killed on the famous Arena Panzerplatte stage.Sordo and Neuville started just 0.8 seconds apart on Sunday as they both went looking for a first-ever top-level success.Sordo gave him a bit of breathing space as he edged out Neuville by 2.2s on the first run through the Dhrontal stage on which all Sunday's action took place.Pushing to the limit, Neuville tried everything to make up that lost ground on the repeat run, but looked set to come up short even before a crash in the final few kilometres cost him the best part of a minute.Mikko Hirvonen made it two Citroens on the podium as he took a solid third position, with Martin Prokop a distant fourth.Robert Kubica was an outstanding fifth as he took the win in the WRC2 class, ahead of Welshman Elfyn Evans.It is Kubica's third success in four rallies and he now leads the class standings.Jari-Matti Latvala recovered to seventh place after his chances of winning for Volkswagen were ended by a crash on Saturday.Hayden Paddon, Mads Ostberg and Evgeny Novikov rounded out the top 10.Championship leader Sebastien Ogier, who crashed his Volkswagen on Friday, salvaged three points from the event as he set the fastest time on the final 'Power Stage'.The Frenchman still leads Neuville by 75 points with four rounds remaining.
