Stefan Nielsen retained the British U19 Championship with a stunning ride to win the Final at Coventry.Nielsen came through the semi-final after scoring 12-points in the qualifiers, but got the better of automatic finalists Ashley Morris and Adam Ellis with a spectacular outside blast on turn two, leaving Morris second and Ben Morley third ahead of Ellis.Nielsen said: "I didn't get gate one, and I didn't make the best start because I lifted a bit, I was third going into the corner but I had the momentum around the outside and it worked a treat."I enjoyed it, it's the first time I've been to Coventry and I'm very happy with the win. I'd like to say a special thank-you to Michael Lee, I borrowed his engine for two meetings before and I felt it would suit this track well from what people were saying, and it was amazing."
