A lawyer involved in the case confirmed the hearing has now been pushed back until next week and the race could officially be staged as planned."The hearing will now take place next week," said the unnamed lawyer. "This means the race can go ahead."The petition seeking the cancellation of the race was lodged with India's Supreme Court earlier this week amid allegations that race organisers Jaypee Sports International Limited did not pay entertainment taxes due on last year's event.Amit Kumar, the activist behind the petition, successfully argued two years ago that Formula 1 was entertainment and not sport, and should not benefit from tax exemptions granted by the state of Uttar Pradesh which hosts the race.Speaking to Sky Sports News, Karun Chandhok said there was never any danger that the race would be cancelled."What happened is that someone filed a Public Interest Litigation, a PIL, with which any member of the public can raise an objection basically saying, 'I think there is something wrong with this race'. The gentleman in question had an issue with the tax laws or something like that," the Sky F1 analyst said."To give you a parallel in the UK, it's like someone living near Brands Hatch or Silverstone saying, 'I don't like the noise. I want to stop the British Grand Prix'."It's one of those issues that needs to be dealt with but the race was never in question."While organisers have refused to comment on the latest petition, entertainment tax has nevertheless been levied on tickets this year for the first time in a move that has hampered sales.A spokesman for the organisers said that only 32,000 tickets had been sold as of Friday morning, barely two days before the race takes place at the 100,000-capacity circuit.Although India will not host a Grand Prix next year for what organisers have called "logistical reasons", F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has pledged that the sport will return to India in early 2015 in a rejigged calendar.This year's event is the third to be held at the Buddh International Circuit as part of a five-race contract.
