Yvan Muller: Won first race in ArgentinaYvan Muller continued his domination of the 2013 World Touring Car Championship with victory in Race 1 in Argentina, while local hero Jose Maria Lopez made history by winning the second race.In Race 1, Frenchman Muller, who sealed pole position by over half a second from Chevrolet team-mate Tom Chilton, never looked in danger of slipping out of the lead as he extended his advantage at the top of the driver's championship to 144 points.Chilton took third place behind Tuenti Racing's Pepe Oriola and Muller was left delighted with his win at the inaugural event at Termas de Rio Hondo."I'm pleased, of course, not only for myself but for the entire team, once again they did a terrific job and gave me a fantastic car," he said."I'm also pleased to win the first race of the WTCC in Argentina - I really enjoyed it, since the track is fast, it's wide and it's easy to overtake."The only real moment it was possible for me to have any contact was right at the start and there was contact from the back which pushed me a little wide."The second race would have endeared the sport to the new fans in Argentina as local hero Lopez became the first man in Touring Car history to win a race on his first appearance.The 30-year-old Wiechers-Sport driver beat the Castrol Honda of Gabriele Tarquini in to second place, with Oriola rounding out the top three.Muller did not have everything his own way in Race 2 as he was forced to serve a drive-through penalty following contact with Tiago Monteiro in a battle for second place.Monteiro went on to secure fourth place at the chequered flag but Muller finished out of the points in 13th.
