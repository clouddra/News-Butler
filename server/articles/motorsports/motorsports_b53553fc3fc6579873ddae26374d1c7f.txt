Sebastien Ogier: Dreaming of Finland victorySebastien Ogier is determined to win the most prestigious race of the season this weekend - the Rally of Finland.Ogier appears to be cruising to the world title - he holds a 64-point lead in the championship race - but he has never won what is known as the 'Grand Prix of Rallying.'Only four men from outside the Nordic nations have ever won the rally - Carlos Sainz, Didier Auriol, Markko Martin and Sebastien Loeb.
    "It is the fastest rally on the calendar. The environment is beautiful and the route very smooth. There are also an awful lot of quick crests and blind corners in Finland. The Finnish drivers are used to this type of route."

Frenchman Ogier wants to join that elite list and believes his team-mate, Finnish star Jari-Matti Latvala, will be his main rival."I would obviously like to hold onto my lead in the World Championship until the end of the season," he said."The comfortable position we find ourselves in allowed us to enjoy the summer break. I want to go on the attack again in Finland, primarily to score important points, but also to put myself in contention for my first win there."I love this rally. However, the Finnish drivers will represent a very stern challenge, particularly my team-mate Jari-Matti Latvala. It is the fastest rally on the calendar. The environment is beautiful and the route very smooth. There are also an awful lot of quick crests and blind corners in Finland. The Finnish drivers are used to this type of route."This year, we will take on the 'Ouninpohja' special stage again - a very famous place in Finland. I will be driving a World Rally Car there for the first time, and am really looking forward to it."Volkswagen team boss Jost Capito said: "For many, the Rally Finland is the epitome of rallying and one of the World Championship's icons."Top speeds of about 200 kilometres per hour, jumps at 170 km/h with roughly 60 metres of air time - it does not get any more spectacular than this, and up to 100,000 enthusiastic fans flock to the route to follow the action live every year."It is a point of honour that Volkswagen should only put on a good, fair show for its fans."
