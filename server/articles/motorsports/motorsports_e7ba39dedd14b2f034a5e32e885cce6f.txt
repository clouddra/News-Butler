Jorge Lorenzo: Clinging on to hopes of retaining MotoGP crownJorge Lorenzo is in no mood to concede his MotoGP world title to rookie sensation Marc Marquez quite yet.Lorenzo heads into Sunday's Australian Grand Prix some 43 points behind Marquez with three races remaining in the 2013 season.A win for Marquez at Philip Island would be enough to secure the title if Lorenzo finishes outside the top two, but the 26-year-old knows it would only take one slip from his Spanish compatriot to throw the championship wide open again."I don't have anything to lose, I have to try and win every race to the end of the season," Lorenzo said."But the title is not over because Marc is still not the world champion, although it is close to impossible because of the points and unless I win this race."I have always been quite fast at Phillip Island although I have never won the MotoGP race there so maybe this can be the first time."Lorenzo won his second title at the picturesque venue south of Melbourne last season, finishing second to six-time winner Casey Stoner, but his record otherwise is poor and includes two nasty crashes.He lost the tip of a finger in one of those crashes at the spectacular turn 12 but those memories will not take away his liking of a corner rated one of the most exciting in the sport.He added: "It goes up and down and if you have the right line you can slide on throttle in fourth gear for a long way at more than 200 km/h."This is the best feeling you can have on a MotoGP bike. You have some tension and are not completely relaxed at this point but it is a great feeling."
