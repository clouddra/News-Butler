Jari-Matti Latvala: Has slim lead ahead of final day of final day in FranceJari-Matti Latvala takes a narrow lead into the final leg of the Rally of France after Thierry Neuville suffered a puncture on Saturday afternoon.Neuville led by 13.1 seconds in his Ford Fiesta RS but lost almost 90secs and slipped down to fifth spot after he hit a stone and deflated a rear tyre .The Belgian's bad luck opened the door to allow Latvala and others to capitalise, and set up an exciting final day with the top four drivers covered by only five seconds.Latvala finished 0.4 seconds clear of Dani Sordo (Citroen), 1.5 seconds ahead of new world champion Sebastien Ogier (VW) and has a 5 second cushion over nine-time champion Sebastien Loeb (Citroen)."It's incredible, the kind of fight we're having," Latvala told wrc.com."It's one of the greatest rallies I have been involved in. I was perhaps too  cautious on a couple of stages, but the main thing is I made no mistakes. I've dug out some little things that have been missing from my driving.""It was raining like hell in there, so bad we were aquaplaning," added Loeb."It's a close fight now and of course we'll do what we can (to win)."I tried to push hard all day but I wasn't always happy with the car, myself, everything. But we're still in the fight so it's not so bad."
