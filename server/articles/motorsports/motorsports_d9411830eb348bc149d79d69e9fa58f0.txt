Colin Turkington: Took two wins at CroftColin Turkington reignited his title hopes with two wins and a second place finish as he dominated at Croft.The eBay BMW driver started from pole for race one and never looked back, leading from lights to flag to win by nearly 10 seconds in the day's only dry race.He was followed home by the works Honda duo, who had been engaged in their own private battle, with Matt Neal prevailing over reigning champion Gordon Shedden.As the cars headed out to the grid for race two, the heavens opened giving the teams a tyre selection headache. MG opted to start both Jason Plato and Sam Tordoff on the wet tyres, with the other 23 drivers choosing slicks.It seemed to have been a good decision for the Triple Eight-run team when the MGs surged into an early lead, but the track quickly dried out and the gamble backfired - Plato and Tordoff finishing 20th and 21st respectively a lap down.That allowed Turkington to take over at the front and once again he was untouchable. Shedden did his best to catch the Northern Irishman but conceded he "didn't have an answer," as the BMW driver eased to his second win of the day.By the time race three got underway the rain had arrived in force and conditions were treacherous.Pole-sitter Adam Morgan was quickly shuffled down the order by the fast starting BMW's of Nick Foster and Rob Collard. Behind them, it was nearly four-wide in places as Turkington battled with the Honda's of Neal, Shedden and Andrew Jordan, as the cars struggled for grip in the opening exchanges.Foster was soon caught and passed by Neal who opened up a gap at the front, which Turkington quickly set about closing once he got past his team-mate. The pair were right on the edge throughout, with the gap just six tenths of a second at the checkered flag. Andrew Jordan completed the podium.BTCC Drivers' Championship1) Matt Neal - Honda - 2242) Andrew Jordan - Pirtek Racing - 2053) Jason Plato - MG - 1884) Gordon Shedden - Honda - 1885) Colin Turkington - eBay Motors - 184
