LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- Pocono Raceway is extending the length of its IndyCar race to 500 miles.IndyCar's return this year was a 400-mile race, in part to fit the event into a broadcast window. The race was part of the ''Triple Crown'' challenge in which a driver could win a $1 million bonus by sweeping the Indianapolis 500, the Pocono race, and the season finale at Fontana.Both Indy and Fontana were 500 miles, but Pocono was 100 miles shorter. Track President Brandon Igdalsky said Friday fans were adamant they wanted the race to be a true 500-miler.Igdalsky also said the NASCAR Truck Series race would be extended from 125 miles to 150 miles.
