Injured Brit Scott Redding has not given up hope of winning this year's Moto2 world titleScott Redding has been passed fit to practice ahead of Sunday's Moto2 race in Japan, where he will hope to keep alive his chances of becoming the first British rider since the late 1970s to win a world grand prix title.The 20-year-old from Gloucestershire slipped off the top of the Moto2 standings when he missed last week's race in Australia after breaking his left wrist in qualifying.His nearest challenger Pol Espargaro won at Phillip Island to move 16 points clear of his British rival with just two rounds remaining.Redding, who is moving up to MotoGP next season with Gresini Honda, underwent surgery in Melbourne at the weekend where a plate and six screws were inserted in his wrist.And, after four days of rehabilitation, he successfully passed a medical at the Motegi circuit on Thursday and declared himself ready to take on his Spanish rival this weekend.Redding said: "There was no way I was going home after Australia, not when there was even an outside chance I could ride in Japan."Even after the surgery on Sunday morning I knew I was going to Japan to try and ride."As the medical staff here at Motegi have now confirmed I'm fit to ride."I have to undergo another assessment after the two free practice sessions on Friday but I'll know straight away whether it's possible to race."If I'm fit to race then the goal has to be to ensure the championship battle goes down to the final round in Valencia for which I'll have had more recovery time."The most recent Brit to win a grand prix world title was Barry Sheene 36 years ago.
