Sebastien Ogier: Leads by 20 seconds in Australia with 12 stages remainingWorld Rally Championship leader Sebastien Ogier boosted his chances of sealing the series title this weekend with victory in all six road stages in the Rally Australia on Friday.Ogier leads the way from Finland's Mikko Hirvonen and Thierry Neuville of Belgium with an elapsed time of more than 58 minutes after stage 10 of 22.The Frenchman takes a 20-second advantage into Saturday, with six stages scheduled, before a further six stages complete the rally on Sunday and was pleased with his day's work."We can say that the day was perfect," Ogier said.The Volkswagen Motorsport driver currently leads Neuville by 75 points in the overall championship and will hope to extend his advantage in Australia, with just three events remaining after this weekend.It won't be straightforward for Ogier with two 50-kilometre stages on Saturday and the usual hazards to be avoided.Sixth-placed Mads Ostberg illustrated exactly what could go wrong for Ogier as he revealed that he hit a rock so hard that his driver's side door lew open during stage eight."We almost went off the road into the trees," Ostberg said. "It's a good job I hit it sideways because if I had hit it with the front of the car, then that would have been it."
