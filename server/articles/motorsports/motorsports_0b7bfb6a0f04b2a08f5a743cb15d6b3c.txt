I will have the usual team around me in the pits and I'm going there focused to get the job done."I've always said my priority is to give my best in every race and we shall see if that's soon enough. I'm aiming for a podium finish on Saturday night, I want to finish the series strongly."I've been having treatment over the last week and the pain is under control, I'm feeling stronger every day and I'm on a good position to go for it in Torun on Saturday."Woffinden is no stranger to the Torun track, which will host the FIM Speedway Grand Prix of Poland.He said: "It's a great stadium and a super track, I love riding there and I think it suits my riding style without a doubt."I'm going to enjoy the occasion because the place will be packed and the atmosphere will be electric. It's a great venue to round off the Grand Prix series."I've not raced there this year, I missed my Polish League meeting there which I was gutted about but I'm so looking forward to Saturday."
