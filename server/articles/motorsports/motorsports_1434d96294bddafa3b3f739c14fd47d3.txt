Sebastien Ogier celebrates his most recent victory in Australia during SeptemberFrenchman Sebastien Ogier is on the brink of clinching his first World Rally title this week and admits he would like to reach the milestone in style.And while Ogier seeks title No 1, his compatriot and nine-time world champion Sebastien Loeb makes his final competitive appearance.Ogier, who drives a VW Pole, is 83 points clear of Thierry Neuville with just 84 up for grabs during the final three races of the season.This week's rally takes place in France and Ogier could secure the title as early as Thursday if Neuville fails to claim the three points awarded to the winner of the opening Power Stage.The Rally of France is being held in the eastern region of Alsace and Ogier admitted: "I am out to win but I want to become world champion with panache."It would be frustrating for me for Loeb to win the rally at the same time as I become world champion."I think I deserve better than that and it's up to me to ensure that this scenario does not occur."As for Loeb, he added: "Obviously, my aim is to achieve the best possible result but you have to bear in mind that I haven't competed in a rally since the start of May. And even then, it was on gravel in Argentina."There's no pressure on me, no championship to go for and I've nothing to prove."I'm here to enjoy myself and thank all the people who have supported me for so long. I hope it'll be a great big party."
