Jorge Lorenzo: Quickest in practice in AustraliaJorge Lorenzo came out on top in both of Friday's practice sessions ahead of the Australian Grand Prix at Phillip Island.Lorenzo beat championship leader Marc Marquez by nearly three-tenths of a second and the rookie also suffered a nasty spill during the afternoon run that briefly had his supporters wondering if it would affect his seemingly simple run towards the title.The 20-year-old high-sided his Repsol Honda and came down heavily on the asphalt, but he was able to get back on his feet fairly quickly and was back on track around 20 minutes later.However he was unable to do anything to topple Lorenzo from the top of the time-sheets, with his lap of one minute 28.961 seconds only three-tenths slower than Casey Stoner's track record.Alvaro Bautista took third place and Dani Pedrosa continued the Spanish dominance by setting the fourth-fastest time ahead of Valentino Rossi and Britain's Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith.Marquez goes into Sunday's race with a 43-point lead over defending champion Lorenzo, and he knows victory will be enough to win the title in his rookie season if Lorenzo fails to finish second."It's a pity about the crash right at the start of the afternoon run but we went back out with the second bike, which had a totally different geometry and we had no time in which to change things," Marquez said."So we used the initial setup for the entire session. We shall see if tomorrow we can regain the feeling that we had in the morning session, as I felt very good."One rider who will not be taking part is Germany's Stefan Bradl, who was allowed to run in opening practice after fracturing his ankle in Malaysia last weekend.But Bradl finished more than four seconds off the pace on his LCR Honda and was later declared unfit to return to the track for the rest of the weekend - he hopes to race in Japan next weekend.
