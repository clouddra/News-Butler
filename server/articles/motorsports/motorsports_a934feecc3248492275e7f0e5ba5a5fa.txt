Sam Tordoff: Raced to pole with a record lapSam Tordoff earned the first pole position of his British Touring Car Championship career following a record-breaking showing during qualifying at Snetterton on Saturday afternoon.The 24-year-old Yorkshireman topped the practice sessions at the Norfolk course with a time of one minute, 57.388 seconds earlier on Saturday and he then smashed that during qualifying when he raced round in 1:56.696.Not only was that enough to earn Tordoff his maiden pole start, but it also broke the existing lap record set last year by Frank Wrathall by almost nine-tenths of a second.Jason Plato made it a MG KX Momentum Racing one-two after finishing second behind his team-mate, with Gordon Shedden (Honda Yuasa) and Andrew Jordan (Pirtek Racing) taking third and fourth places respectively in the sixth round of the BTTC season.A delighted Tordoff told www.btcc.net: "I'm thrilled with that. We knew we had the pace - we showed it in the test during the summer break, but you never know how the weekend is going to pan out."The first thing you've got to do as a racing driver is beat your team-mate, and when that means beating Jason Plato it's no mean feat."This gives us the perfect opportunity for tomorrow - I've shown I've got what it takes to beat the guys around me, now it's time to go and do it."An impressed Plato said of his colleague: "He nailed the lap, his performances this year are coming on leaps and bounds - he's really in the groove now and that's one of the reasons we got him in the car because we knew he was going to be quick."Not that there was a monkey on his back because he's already done such a great job, but from now his demeanour will change and that will make him even quicker."Championship leader Matt Neal came home in 11th place. Neal (224) boasts a 21-point lead over Jordan (205) at the top of the standings with Shedden and Plato joint third on 188 points.
