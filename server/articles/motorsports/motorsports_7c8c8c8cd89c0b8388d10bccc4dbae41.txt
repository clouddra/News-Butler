Podium eludes AlonsoFernando Alonso has admitted Ferrari simply didn't possess the raw pace to catch the Red Bulls and Lotus of Romain Grosjean in the Japanese GP.Although the Spaniard was able to cross the line in fourth place in order to keep his slender World Championship hopes mathematically alive, Alonso has fallen ninety points behind Sebastian Vettel in the standings and was a peripheral figure in Sunday's race as the F138 struggled to match the speed of the frontrunners.Having trailed Nico Hulkenberg for much of the 53 laps after moving past team-mate Felipe Massa, Alonso was eventually able to pass the Sauber with seven laps remaining to cement his position at the top of F1's all-time points-scoring chart ahead of Michael Schumacher.After being informed of his record-breaking feat, the Spaniard tweeted:To see my name leading the points record for a sport like Formula 1 is something I never imagined. Thanks to everyone! 1571 points.However, Alonso was less enthused by another frustrating day at the office."The traffic was the story of the race as I was always behind someone," he told Sky Sports F1. "But to be honest, the top three were too strong for us and even without traffic the podium was already settled after the first couple of laps."Both Grosjean and Red Bull deserve it because they were quicker than us, so fourth is the maximum we could have achieved, and it was important for the Constructors' Championship today as Mercedes didn't have a good day - so happy for that."Courtesy of Alonso's fourth place and Felipe Massa's point-scoring tenth, Ferrari have increased their lead over Mercedes in second place in the Constructors' Championship to ten points.But with Vettel and Red Bull on cusp of landing their fourth successive title double, it appears as if the Scuderia are already contemplating switching focus onto the upcoming challenge of the 2014 'rules revolution'."For the last four races, we will evaluate if it is worth bringing some improvements to motivate the drivers and teams over the closing stages of this championship," confirmed technical chief Pat Fry.
