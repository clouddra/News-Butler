Eric Boullier: Is hoping Lotus can maintain their current formEric Boullier says Lotus can finish second in the Constructors' Championship if they maintain their current run of form.The Enstone-based squad are currently fourth in the standings, 33 points behind second-placed Ferrari and 23 points behind Mercedes who are third.However, in the last two races Lotus have scored 58 points compared with 23 for Ferrari and 20 for Mercedes and Boullier is hoping they can continue to score big points in the remaining four races."If we continue as we have done for the last few races, then mathematically second in the standings becomes a very attainable target," the Frenchman said."Of course, we all know that anything can happen in this sport, but second place would be an amazing result so we'll push as hard as we can and you never know what might happen."Boullier admits that race wins will be difficult to achieve given the pace of the Red Bulls, but he is clear in what he expects his team to achieve."Podiums, podiums and podiums," he added. "We need points to help us with our Championship fight and you score the most points when you're spraying the champagne! Of course, we want to be winning races and we'll give our all whenever there is a sniff of victory, just like in Japan."There's one fundamental problem with trying to win at the moment, and that's the pace of the Red Bulls. We'll keep pushing and if we can beat them again this year it would be a tremendous performance."Another impressive drive from Romain Grosjean saw him finish third in Japan as he looks to put the incidents that plagued last season behind him and Boullier has once again hinted that the Frenchman will be retained in 2014."There are no announcements yet but there is plenty going on behind the scenes," he confirmed."We know that Kimi is headed elsewhere for next season, but we also know that Romain would bring good continuity as well as the strong performance potential we've seen recently."There are a number of other good drivers on the market at the moment, so we're in a strong position of being able to assess the possibilities. A race seat with Lotus F1 Team is pretty hot property at the moment, so we're confident we'll have a strong line-up in 2014."
