Giedo van der Garde: Hopes to have some new soonCaterham rookie Giedo van der Garde is hopeful he can stay in Formula 1 for a second season.Speaking at the Indian Grand Prix on Thursday, the 28-year-old Dutchman said he is discussing fresh terms with the Leafield outfit - and also revealed that he has been having talks with rival teams."Of course, I hope to stay next year. The management is very busy talking to some teams, also Caterham. At the moment, they told me to be focused for the last four races," Van der Garde said in the FIA press conference."Hopefully we'll have some news soon. But it's still far away."Van der Garde currently stands 21st in the Drivers' Championship having been outperformed by team-mate Charles Pic.Pic, of course, has an additional year's experience but Van der Garde reckons he is now a match for the Frenchman."At the beginning I struggled a little bit then in the middle of the season everything fell into place. I have good speed," he said."I still have to improve the qualifying but race pace has been very good."Van der Garde could not demonstrate his race pace in the Japanese Grand Prix after a first-corner collision with Jules Bianchi's Marussia.Although Caterham have had the measure of their rivals for most of the season, Bianchi's 13th place-finish in Malaysia means that Marussia still hold the all-important tenth place in the Constructors' Championship.With four races including this weekend's still to run, Van der Garde admitted that Caterham were starting to feel the pressure."A little bit. Of course, for us it's important to get tenth place back. I think in the last few races, we've always seen that we're in front in the races compared to Marussia," he added."The only thing we can do is maximise ourselves, maximise the car and maximise the team. The rest is luck."
