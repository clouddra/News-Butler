The provisional 2014 calendar is set to be reduced to 20 races with New Jersey and Mexico poised to lose their slots, according to reports.With Bernie Ecclestone making his first appearance in the F1 paddock at Abu Dhabi since September, the highly-respected Adam Cooper blog has reported that, in yet another change to the proposed calendar, both Mexico and New Jersey will be dropped from the schedule to be ratified by the FIA at the end of the year.Both the Mexico and New Jersey races were given provisional status on the draft calendar released at the end of September but their reported omission could spark further upheaval, with the season-ending Brazilian GP likely to be brought forward a week and the U.S. GP given a back-to-back slot with the Interlagos event.The shedding of the New Jersey race, scheduled for the first week of June, would also remove the unprecedented prospect of three races being run in as many weeks.Paddock rumour in Abu Dhabi has also suggested that the season-opening Australian and Malaysian GPs will be run on consecutive weekends to ease the logistical demands being placed on the teams. Even if the calendar is reduced to 20 races, it would still be the joint-longest in the sport's history.Meanwhile, Ecclestone has voiced his optimism that India, dropped for next year, will return for 2015."It's all done," he told The Observer. "We just need the government to do their bit." Ecclestone hinted that the race would go back to India in 2015 in a new long-term deal.The Provisional 2014 calendar released in September:16th March - Australia30th March - Malaysia6th April - Bahrain20th April - China27th April - Korea (provisional)11th May - Spain25th May - Monaco1st June - USA, New Jersey (provisional)8th June - Canada22nd June - Austria6th July - Britain20th July - Germany20th July - Germany24th August - Belgium7th September - Italy21st September - Singapore5th October - Russia12th October - Japan26th October - Abu Dhabi9th November - USA, Austin16th November - Mexico (provisional)30th November - Brazil.
