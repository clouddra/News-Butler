Tom Sykes closes in on World Superbike titleTom Sykes took a giant step towards securing his maiden World Superbike Championship title by winning both races at Magny-Cours on Sunday.The 28-year-old Huddersfield-born rider dominated both races in France to extend his lead in the standings to 37 points with just one more round remaining later this month.Sykes led from start to finish in both races to extend his lead over his closest challengers for the title - Eugene Laverty and Sylvain Guintoli.Irishman Laverty followed a third place finish in the opener by taking the runners-up spot in the next.Frenchman Guintoli swapped places with Laverty who now holds second place in the championship - but only by a single point.The first race was cut short by two laps following a red flag when Mark Aitchison crashed.At this stage Sykes led Guintoli by 2.146 seconds, with Laverty a further eight and a half seconds adrift.Race two was a lot more comfortable for the Kawasaki rider who was more than 11 seconds clear when the red flag was waved again.On this occasion it was the Aprilias of Laverty and Guintoli that came to grief in light drizzle on turn five.Both riders returned to the pits unhurt, while the results were based on times and positions at the end of lap 21.At this stage Laverty was a mere 0.246 ahead of Guintoli and was awarded second spot.Sykes now heads to Jerez in Spain for the final two races of the season with the title within touching distance.He requires just 14 more points for the championship which, barring a complete disaster, should be easily attained in Iberia on October 20.
