Robert Kubica: Will be ditching his WRC 2 Citroen in WalesRobert Kubica has been handed a drive in the Citroen World Rally Car for the season-ending Wales Rally GB next month.The former Formula One driver has spent the season in the WRC2 version of Citroen's DS3 and can put the seal on a category title with victory in the Catalunya Rally next week.That would put him out of the reach of sole rival Abdulaziz Al-Kuwari, who is driving the WRC Ford Fiesta next week before stepping back into his WRC2 seat in Wales."This one-off outing for the works team is a great opportunity for me, but it's also a huge challenge," said Kubica, who has four category wins from six outings this season."Wales Rally GB wasn't part of my original programme, so I'm very happy to be able to have this precious experience. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my partners, and especially the Lotos Group and Citroen Racing for having made this possible."Citroen boss Yves Matton said the drive was a reward for Kubica's fine form: "There is no doubt his motivation and professional attitude mean he can set his sights on securing a good result."It's true that, as things stand, he hasn't won the title. But even if he doesn't win it in Spain, he has still had a very successful season. He is, therefore, perfectly entitled to have a go at Wales Rally GB."Andrew Coe, speaking for race organisers International Motor Sports Ltd, added: "We welcome Robert Kubica to Wales Rally GB, and are delighted to announce that both our international and national entry lists have not only exceeded expectations, but also feature some of the greatest names in modern day rallying."Having Kubica compete at our event, which has been named the Rally of Legends, will be a treat for all the fans that will be lining the route and avidly watching the action as it unfolds in the Welsh forests."
