Paul Di Resta wants his future decided soonPaul Di Resta has called for a swift decision on his Force India future after doing his hopes of staying on with the team a power of good with a sixth-place finish in Abu Dhabi.With the team understood to have offered Nico Hulkenberg a two-season deal just twelve months after the German left the Silverstone outfit, Di Resta's future both with Force India and in F1 has been plunged into doubt following a wretched run of form since the summer break.However, after returning to points-scoring ways in India a week ago following seven races out of the top ten, the Scot delivered an impressive drive under the lights of the Yas Marina Circuit to register an "an awesome result" which could reap further reward in the form of a contract extension."I've always said I would like to stay with the team - I would like to stay in F1 more importantly - but if they give me the tools I can deliver," the Scot told Sky Sports F1. "I will be expecting a decision very soon from the senior management, but I will keep focusing on the races and let the management team do the business in the background."

With Di Resta's team-mate Adrian Sutil also finishing in the points after their team elected to run both on one-stop strategies, Force India have also taken a firm grip of sixth place in the Constructors' Championship."Defending our position against Sauber in the Constructors' Championship was the main aim, but we went into the race with a car that was much better than it was in qualy - we did a very good job yesterday - but from the strategy guys to the engineer we put everything in place for a good race," added Di Resta."I managed the tyres when I had to, delivered when I had to, but I think more importantly staying ahead of a Mercedes and fighting a Ferrari - what more could you ask for? We finished off the job we should have done in Singapore on tyre wear and hopefully we can take this momentum to Texas."
