Jorge Lorenzo: Took pole position at Motegi ahead of Marc MarquezJorge Lorenzo continued his fight to retain the MotoGP title by taking pole position for the Japanese Grand Prix at Motegi.The Yamaha rider set a fastest lap of 1 minute 53.471 seconds on a wet track to secure top spot ahead of championship rival and fellow Spaniard Marc Marquez.Repsol Honda's Marquez currently leads the standings by 18 points and could become the first rookie to win the title if he outscores Lorenzo by eight points on Sunday.Nicky Hayden completed the front row on his Ducati, while Marquez's team-mate Dani Pedrosa and Italian pair Valentino Rossi and Andrea Dovizioso completed the top six.The race weekend at Motegi has been severely disrupted by adverse weather, with Friday's running wiped out by fog and rain also cancelling Saturday's practice, meaning qualifying was extended to 75 minutes."It was quite difficult, it was my first time in Motegi, first time in qualifying without any practice sessions, in wet conditions and I took more risks than usual," Marquez said."But we did a very good job because our target was the front row and we did it. We are hoping for a dry race."Lorenzo added: "I am very happy to get this second pole position in a row. It was hard because the last time I rode in the wet was in Assen, so at the beginning I was careful and not so confident and a bit scared."Little by little, I got better and in the end did a very good lap. Tomorrow is probably going to be dry so let's see what happens."
