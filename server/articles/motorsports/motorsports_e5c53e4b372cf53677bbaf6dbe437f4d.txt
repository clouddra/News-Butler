TALLADEGA, Ala. ? Earnhardt Ganassi Racing's Juan Pablo Montoya will end his career as a full-time driver on the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series without a restrictor-plate win following his involvement in a two-car incident that ended his day during the Camping World RV Sales 500 at Talladega Superspeedway.Montoya, who will end an seven-year run as a full-time Cup driver to compete in IndyCar next season for team owner Roger Penske, was a victim of circumstances here Sunday.Running mid-pack on Lap 79, his No. 42 Target Chevrolet was riding along in the low line through the tri-oval when the No. 9 Ford of Marcos Ambrose suddenly turned left, came down the track and collected Montoya."I didn't see much," Montoya said after being released from the infield care center. "I was on the bottom and we were running two wide; all of a sudden it started being three wide."My spotter said I needed to get out; I backed off coming through the tri-oval, the 99 (of Carl Edwards) was getting out with us. I just saw out of the corner of my eye a car coming across."It sucks."Montoya, 38, has two career wins in Cup, both coming on the series' road courses of Sonoma (2007) and Watkins Glen (2010). He entered Sunday's race 21st in the standings, with seven top-10s. His best result this season was a runner-up finish at Dover in June.It was Montoya's fourth career DNF at Talladega, but just his first DNF of the 2013 season. Montoya finished in 41st-place on the day.MORE: View gallery.View gallery
