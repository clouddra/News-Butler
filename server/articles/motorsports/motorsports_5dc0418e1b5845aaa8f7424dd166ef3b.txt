Jason Plato: Won two of Sunday's three races at Oulton ParkJason Plato injected fresh impetus into his British Touring Car Championship title challenge after winning two of Sunday's three races at Oulton Park.The two-time champion led home team-mate Sam Tordoff in an uneventful opening race to secure his MG KX Momentum Racing a maiden one-two finish. Reigning champion Gordon Shedden came home in third place for Honda.Plato followed up with another lights-to-flag win in race two, ensuring in the process the satisfaction of having led every lap of the first two races.Tordoff could not replicate his result, however, and fell back as a result of tyre issues before clashing with Mat Jackson late on and finishing out of the points.Shedden came home in second to seal back-to-back podiums, while Colin Turkington (eBay Motors BMW) took third.Pirtek Racing's Andrew Jordan won the final BTCC race of the day, inheriting the lead when team-mate Jeff Smith span out with three laps remaining, with Turkington second and Adam Morgan (Ciceley Racing Toyota) taking a maiden podium with third.Plato became one of seven retirements in a busy closing race when his car caught fire on lap four, but the veteran racer was nevertheless the big winner overall as he moved onto 166 points in the drivers' standings, just seven shy of leader Matt Neal, who had a low-key day for Honda, taking a pair of fourth places and a sixth.Driver Championship Standings: 1 Matt Neal (Gbr) Honda 173pts, 2 Andrew Jordan (Gbr) Honda 169, 3 Jason Plato (Gbr) MG 166, 4 Gordon Shedden (Gbr) Honda 142, 5 Sam Tordoff (Gbr) MG 129, 6 Colin Turkington (Gbr) BMW 123, 7 Adam Morgan (Gbr) Toyota 116, 8 Jeff Smith (Gbr) Honda 97, 9 Tom Onslow-Cole (Gbr) Volkswagen 72, 10 Aron Smith (Irl) Ford 66.
