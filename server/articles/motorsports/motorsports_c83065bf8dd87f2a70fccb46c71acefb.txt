"Citroen Racing has spent the last few months looking in detail at the opportunity of going ahead with this programme," said chief executive Frederic Banzet."The WTCC is based on several aspects that are essential to Citroen: extensive media coverage, regulations that keep costs down and a genuinely global race calendar."Our involvement in this championship will also help us to develop the brand in promising, growth markets such as China, Russia and South America."Loeb added: "I can't wait to get out on track in the car and start testing. I have used this transitional year to try out various experiences and to improve my track driving skills."I don't expect to win straight away, but I am determined to get there one day."Citroen also confirmed they will continue to run a World Rally Championship team in some form, with team principal Yves Matton feeling their platform in rallying will help the fledgling WTCC team."Competing in a category for the first time, starting from scratch, gives our division a superb challenge," said Matton, who earlier revealed his hopes that Loeb would drive a couple more rallies than planned over the rest of 2013."Having said that, we will be able to re-use a large part of our existing expertise, starting with the DS3 WRC's 1.6-litre direct injection turbo engine."Work has already begun in our Versailles technical centre and is set to be stepped up in the coming weeks, with the first tests of our car and the start of our development programme to prepare for the 2014 season."Obviously, we're still committed to rallying and we'll continue to work hard to try and get the best possible result in 2013."
