Tai Woffinden: World champion on the mend after surgeryWorld champion Tai Woffinden is on the road to recovery after having his collarbone re-broken during surgery on Wednesday.Scunthorpe-born Woffinden went under the knife at the Derby Nuffield Hospital to repair the damage he sustained in two horror crashes on the Grand Prix circuit this season.He said: "I'm starting my winter training programme in the next three weeks."I'm in a lot of pain right now because they re-broke the collarbone and put a new plate in it. At least I know it's now in place and in six weeks from now I will go back there and have the metal taken out."I'd like to thank the staff at Derby Nuffield for their help and assistance with the surgery."Woffinden is flying out to the United States this weekend as a guest of Monster Energy before heading back to his British track Wolverhampton to attend their Banks's Olympique individual event.He said: "I'm going to the Monster Energy Cup which I'm really excited about. I fly from Heathrow on Friday morning and then I come back in time to show my medal to the Wolverhampton fans on Tuesday."It's going to be a hectic few days but I'm going to enjoy it."
