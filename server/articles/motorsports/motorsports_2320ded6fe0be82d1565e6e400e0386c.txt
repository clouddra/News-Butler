In dry conditions we know what to expect."Sykes is joined on the front row by one of his title rivals in Sylvain Guintoli, with Eugene Laverty in fourth place after Althea Aprilia's Davide Giugliano pipped him to complete the front row.Guintoli lies third in the season standings 24 points back, while his Aprilia Racing team-mate Laverty is second, a point better off than the Frenchman.Italian pair Michele Fabrizio and Ayrton Badovini are also on the second row, ahead of Marco Melandri, Chaz Davies and Vincent Philippe, who is a substitute for the injured Leon Camier.
