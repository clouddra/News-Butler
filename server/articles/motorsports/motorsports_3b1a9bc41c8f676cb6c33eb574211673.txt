Poole Pirates head north to Birmingham on Tuesday nightPoole promoter Matt Ford says his side should not take a defensive attitude as they go into the re-arranged Sky Live Elite League Grand Final at Birmingham.The meeting was put back by a day due to heavy rain and now takes place tonight at 7pm, with Poole taking a 57-36 lead into the second leg after an impressive display at Wimborne Road last week.Ford said: "Our philosophy will be to forget about our first leg lead to an extent - and stop them getting the heat advantages they are going to need."Every heat that we can prevent them pulling any points back will be another race when it becomes more important that they have to do it in the next one, and so on."But to do that we have to have a team who have proved over the last two Mondays that they can dig in and attack and frustrate the opposition at the same time. We have to ride with that same spirit."Meanwhile, former Elite League Riders' Champion Rory Schlein has joined the field for this year's event at Swindon on Saturday.Schlein, who triumphed in 2011, is one of four additions to the line-up along with Chris Harris, Grzegorz Zengota and home star Troy Batchelor as Danny King, Greg Hancock and injured duo Tai Woffinden and Matej Zagar miss out.SpeedwayGB Events co-ordinator David Hoggart said: "We are very pleased with the quality of replacements and what's also pleasing is how keen they were to do the meeting."Rory's victory in the Final a couple of years ago was one of the big highlights of this event's recent history, and we all know what Chris can do on his day."Bringing in Troy will be good news for the home supporters and there's no doubt he has the class to do well, and Greg (Zengota) has also been really keen to race on his old home track, so it still promises to be an excellent meeting and we look forward to seeing everyone at Swindon."
