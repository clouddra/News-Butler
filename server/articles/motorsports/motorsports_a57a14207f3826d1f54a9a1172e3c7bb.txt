RELATED: Full Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup coverageDanica Patrick hit the wall in Turn 2 during Friday's opening practice session at Martinsville Speedway, and her No. 10 Chevrolet was damaged enough for the team to unload the backup car.
Patrick had run 35 laps in the practice session at the 0.526-mile track before the incident, which occurred approximately 30 minutes into the 90-minute session.
She did return to the track in her backup car with about 10 minutes left in the practice session.

Patrick ran well at the short track in the spring race, finishing 12th, which is the second-best finish of her rookie season. She is currently 28th in the point standings.
