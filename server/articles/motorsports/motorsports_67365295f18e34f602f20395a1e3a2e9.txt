Amy Williams has qualified for next month's world rally championship event in WalesOlympic golden girl Amy Williams has successfully graduated to international rally status by qualifying to compete in next month's World Championship event in Wales.The 31-year-old from Bath won gold at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver competing in the skeleton class.Earlier this year she switched her attention to rallying and has been a co-driver with Tony Jardine, a former motorsport competitor who now works as an F1 analyst with Sky Sports.To compete in the four-day Wales Rally, which starts on November 14, Williams needed to complete four events at national level.And she did so over the weekend when she and Jardine survived a tough test over the tricky off-road stages of the Cambrian Rally.All nine stages were in the forests close to Llandudno and Williams confessed: "Tony and I had arrived late in Wales after very tight schedules."I had been delayed in Turkey by twenty two hours and was short of sleep but we pulled off a super result."I am relieved as it was so difficult, yet elated as I am now international status."Jardine added: "We were in blinding rain on the tough North Wales stages. The going was soft then rocky and as slick as an oil field."We couldn't get a rhythm and on a downhill section we slithered sideways as I was too fast and Amy's delivery of the notes was too slow."Somehow we missed going backwards over a drop."The pair finished 20th in the Cambrian event, six minutes and 24 seconds adrift of winner Euan Thorburn.
