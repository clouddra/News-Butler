Sebastien Ogier: Has won eight of this season's 12 roundsWorld champion Sebastien Ogier produced a stunning comeback to surpass Jari-Matti Latvala on Sunday to win the Rally of Spain.The Frenchman, who has already secured the 2013 drivers' crown, had started the final day in fourth place, 46.5 seconds behind Volkswagen team-mate and event leader Jari-Matti Latvala having suffered a puncture on Saturday.But by the halfway point of Sunday's six stages, run mainly on gravel after Friday and Saturday's asphalt tests, he had risen to third and was just 14.4 seconds adrift.He continued to pile on the pressure and on the penultimate stage he overhauled Latvala as second-placed man Dani Sordo ground to a halt.Latvala's hopes ended when his car finished that test with flames visible under the bonnet, which were quickly extinguished by marshals.Ogier's ultimate victory margin was 32.9 seconds and Mikko Hirvonen was third as he benefited from the misfortune of Sordo and Ford's Thierry Neuville, who lost places with a puncture on Sunday morning.Neuville eventually claimed fourth spot, ahead of team-mate Evgeny Novikov and Mads Ostberg.Martin Prokop, Hayden Paddon, WRC2 class winner Robert Kubica and Abdulaziz Al-Kuwari rounded out the top 10.Kubica's win, his fifth from seven events, was enough for him to be crowned WRC2 champion.The final event of the season will be held in Wales from November 13-17.
