Dani Sordo: Benefitted from the demise of LatvalaDani Sordo of Spain claimed the lead in the Rally of Germany on a day marred by the death of two Dutch drivers in a support race.Sordo led after title hopeful Jari-Matti Latvala crashed out in a collision with Thierry Neuville, who also came off the road, on a rain-hit bend.A brake disc was ripped from Latvala's Volkswagen Polo in the accident while Neuville's Ford Fiesta suffered just a dent although the Belgian completed the 12th stage with a log jammed underneath the rear of the car."You couldn't see the corner, it was so slippery," said Neuville."Latvala touched and we touched the same. I saw his brake disc in the corner. I tried to slow down but it was too late and we weren't pushing."It was second gear, that was all. I couldn't avoid it. It was like ice and many drivers will have problems there."World championship leader Sebastien Ogier had retired from the race on Friday.The final stage of the day was cancelled following the fatal crash in which the vehicle, taking part in an historic car event, plummeted off the track."Everyone associated with the event extends their deepest sympathies and condolences to the families, friends and individuals who are being touched by today's terrible tragedy," read a statement from the organisers.
