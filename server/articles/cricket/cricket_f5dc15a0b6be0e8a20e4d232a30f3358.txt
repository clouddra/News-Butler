Glamorgan have awarded new contracts to five homegrown players.Batsmen Ben Wright, Will Bragg and David Lloyd have all agreed two-year deals, as have spinner Andrew Salter and all-rounder Ruaidhri Smith.Hugh Morris will take on the dual role of chief executive and director of cricket at his old county when he leaves his post with England in the New Year and he says young Welsh talent is key to future success."Following the recent good news that senior pros in Mark Wallace and Dean Cosker have committed to the Club, it's good to see promising young talent from both North and South Wales extending their playing careers with Glamorgan and continuing to fly the flag for Wales," he said."I believe the key for our sustained success is to develop our own talent such as players like these."I was very lucky to play in a Glamorgan side the spine of which was Welsh and this is something which I will be focusing on developing with our new head coach and the rest of the coaching staff."
