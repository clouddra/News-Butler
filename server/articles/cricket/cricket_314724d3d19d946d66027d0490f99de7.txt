    Ballance edged Ryan Duffield behind, and Prior - leading country for the first time in 
    
Alastair Cook's injury-enforced absence 

     - followed in similar fashion in the same over.
    Ben Stokes - like Ballance, a contender to bat at six in the Test side - was then caught behind off Jim Allenby.
    Trott brought up a 200-ball century that contained 10 fours and a six, but the tail fell cheaply as Allenby finished with 4-58.
    The collapse at least gave England another chance to assess the merits of their three tall seamers, Boyd Rankin, Chris Tremlett and Steven Finn, who are expected to contest the final bowling spot for the 
    
first Test against Australia in Brisbane 

     starting on 21 November.
    Rankin's match figures of 3-126 were the best of the trio. Although he removed openers Luke Towers and Marcus Harrisin the second innings, Chris Lynn - dropped on 12 by Rankin and on 19 by Joe Root - closed on 61 not out.
    He shared a third-wicket partnership of 100 with Mitchell Marsh, who was the first of two victims for Finn.
    "They've improved through the three days - got rid of that bit of rustiness," Prior said of his seamers.
    "Steven Finn bowled a long spell there. Certainly (in) the last four or five overs he really was hitting his straps again and his pace was up.
    "Boyd Rankin was fantastic all day. A bloke with such height, and good pace and bounce, on these wickets could be a pretty useful weapon over here.
    "Tremlett again just got better and better, more rhythm as the game went on."
    Prior added: "Our batters did fantastically. With the emphasis on big first-innings scores over here, we've not shied away from saying we need to score big runs."
