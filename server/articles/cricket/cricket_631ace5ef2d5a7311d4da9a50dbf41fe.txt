    Boyd Rankin was only three games into his international career when he helped trigger one of the cricketing shocks of all time in 2007, bowling Ireland to 
    
a famous World Cup win over Pakistan 

     in Jamaica,
    He then caused another stir this summer when, having swapped countries, 
    
he enjoyed an impressive introduction to limited-overs international cricket with England.
    That helped get the 6ft 8in Warwickshire fast bowler 
    
on the plane to Australia this winter.
    Coupled with the faith of a man who clearly believes in him - 
    
his old Bears boss Ashley Giles, now England's limited-overs coach 

     - Rankin now has the opportunity to deliver the goods on a stage on which he surely never seriously believed he would one day perform.
    Current Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown has no doubts that this Northern Ireland farmer's son, one of Test cricket's later starters at 29,, can perform at the highest level. 
    "He's certainly shown why he's been picked," Brown told BBC WM.
    "He bowled a couple of terrifying spells in our final game of the season at Derby. And that bodes well for England.
    "He's bowled well in one-day cricket which previously he'd never had the chance to do.
    "And now he's got himself onto the England radar and into the Ashes tour party. The stage is set for him."
    The same positive outlook comes from elsewhere in the Edgbaston dressing-room, from this summer's chief Ashes hero, Ian Bell, now his team-mate both for county and country.
