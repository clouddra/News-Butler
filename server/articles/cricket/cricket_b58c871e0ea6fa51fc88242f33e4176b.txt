England ended their tour match against the Western Australia Chairman's XI on a disappointing note in Perth after the middle order failed to stake their claim for a Test spot.The tourists collapsed from 330-2 to 391 all out following the retirement of centurion Ian Bell, before the Aussies reached 168-5 before a stalemate was agreed.England at least had the opportunity to again assess the merits of their threetall seamers, Boyd Rankin emerging marginally - certainly not head and shoulders - above Chris Tremlett and Steven Finn.England had looked to be in complete control as first Bell and then Jonathan Trott went on to complete their centuries at the WACA.Starting the day on 77, Bell picked up where he left off as he reached three figures off 153 balls - with back-to-back boundaries off Matt Dixon seeing him to the landmark.Bell eventually retired for 115, having hit 19 fours and two sixes, in a bid to let the lower order spend some time at the middle.However they failed in spectacular fashion - with England losing three wickets for 17 runs as Gary Ballance, Matt Prior and Ben Stokes fell cheaply.

                        England start warm-up with a draw                    Yorkshire batsman Ballance was dismissed for a first-ball duck, while acting captain Prior and all-rounder Stokes added just four each.Ballance was caught behind by Tom Triffitt off Ryan Duffield, while Prior followed the same way four balls later.Stokes, who endured a torrid time with the ball, added just four before he was caught by Triffitt off James Allenby.Trott and Finn steadied the ship with a 35-run stand. However Finn was bowled for 15 by Michael Beer, with the Chairman's XI skipper trapping Tremlett leg before two balls later.James Anderson added eight before he edged Allenby behind, with Rankin falling for a golden duck to leave Trott stranded on 113 not out.Home openers Luke Towers and Marcus Harris had set the tone two days ago with a stand of 115, but this time both fell cheaply to Rankin, Towers caught at third slip to a ball that bounced traditionally at this venue and Harris playing no shot to go lbw to one that kept low after hitting a crack.With Test linchpin James Anderson spared any unnecessary second-innings bowling exertions, change bowlers Finn and Stokes might also each have had an early wicket - but Lynn was dropped on 12 by Rankin diving to his left at mid on off the former and then on 19 by Joe Root high to his right at second slip.Finn eventually got his second and third wickets of the match, Marsh lbw and Tom Triffitt caught-behind in the same over, before Tremlett claimed a first victim of the match shortly before the captains shook hands.Watch the Ashes live on Sky Sports this winter, beginning with the opening Test at the Gabba.
