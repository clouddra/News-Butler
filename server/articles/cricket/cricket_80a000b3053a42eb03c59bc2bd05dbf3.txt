    Peter Moores tells BBC Radio Lancashire that he would like to guide his team to one-day success after 
    
agreeing to remain as coach of the Red Rose county 

     until the end of the 2015 season.
    The 50-year-old was in charge as Lancashire ended their 77-year wait to win the Championship in 2011 and led the side to the Division Two title this year.
    But they have not won a one-day competition since 1999 and Moores is determined to end that trophy drought.
