Young batsman Matt Machan has signed a new two-year deal with Sussex.Brighton-born left-hander Machan, 22, is a product of the county's age group system and has been playing for the Sharks since he turned 13.He made his maiden first-class century this season against Somerset at Taunton and played a starring role in Sussex's Yorkshire Bank 40 team, averaging 64.25.His form was enough to secure a first international call with Scotland, for whom he qualifies through his parents, and he made his maiden ODI century when scoring 114 against Kenya in June."I'm delighted to have signed a new contract with Sussex. After having a breakthrough season this year, there was only one place that I could see me playing my cricket over the next couple of years," Machan said."I'd like to thank everyone who has helped me to get to where I am now and I will continue to work hard to achieve my current and future goals."
