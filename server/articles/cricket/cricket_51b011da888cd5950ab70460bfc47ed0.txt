James Faulkner hit 64 not out from 29 balls to see Australia to a target of 304 and a four-wicket win over India in the third one-day international in Chandigarh.Faulkner, batting at number eight, slammed two fours and six sixes, four of which came during the 48th over of the innings, bowled by Ishant Sharma (1-63), which went for 30 runs.That reduced the equation for Australia from 44 off 18 balls to 14 needed from 12 deliveries and Faulkner duly finished off proceedings by launching the third delivery of the final over for another maximum.He had come to the crease with Australia, who now lead the seven-match series 2-1, struggling on 213-6 in the 42nd over.But an unbroken partnership of 91 with Adam Voges (76no) turned the game around and meant India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni finished on the losing side despite earlier scoring 139 not out.Dhoni's ninth ODI century guided his side to a total of 303-9 after they had been sent in to bat by Australia, who were keen to avoid a repeat of the second match in Pune earlier in the week when they were beaten despite setting India a target of 360.Virat Kohli (68) and Dhoni put on 72 for the fifth wicket after India had slipped to 76-4 after 13 overs.Paceman Mitchell Johnson worked his way through the middle order for figures of 4-46 but Australia could not get rid of Dhoni, who faced 121 balls and hit 12 fours and five sixes.Australia's top four all made starts but wickets fell regularly, including two for seamer Vinay Kumar (2-50).When George Bailey (43), Glenn Maxwell (3) and Brad Haddin (24) all departed in quick succession, the required-rate had spiralled above 10 with less than nine overs remaining - but that proved no problem for Faulkner.The series continues in Ranchi on Wednesday.
