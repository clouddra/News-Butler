    Derbyshire batting coach David Houghton has left the club as part of cost-cutting measures following 
    
a management review.Â 
    The 56-year-old former Zimbabwe captain was Derbyshire director of cricket from 2003-07 and 
    
rejoined in 2011.
    Head coach Karl Krikken praise Houghton for his "magnificent service".
    "We have been extremely lucky to have someone with David's experience and everyone who has worked with him will have benefited," Krikken added.
    Houghton's role was the paid specialist coaching fund, but the club have not yet been able to commit to this again for next season.
