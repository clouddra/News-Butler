Former Australia captain Ian Chappell hopes selectors ignore the public clamour for George Bailey to be named in their Ashes squad.Bailey, until now, has been widely regarded as a limited overs specialist but his form for Hampshire in the County Championship and the recent one-day series against India has him knocking at the door of a Test berth.He will head straight into four-day action for Tasmania against Queensland in midweek, opting not to take the option to rest for the second round of Sheffield Shield games to hone his skills against the red ball.
