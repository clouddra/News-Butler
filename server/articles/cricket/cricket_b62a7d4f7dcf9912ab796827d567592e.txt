Middlesex opener Sam Robson has signed a new two-year deal with the club.Australia-born Robson had an outstanding season, scoring 1180 runs at 47.20 and coincidently became qualified to play for England in the summer.He became the subject of interest between Australia, the country of his birth, and England, where he moved at the age of 18.Robson played for Australia Under-19 but never made a first-class appearance in his homeland.Middlesex picked him up from club cricket, gave him his debut in 2009 and are currently reaping the benefits.England have now made their claim on the player by selecting him for the performance programme squad which travels Down Under this winter.Middlesex director of cricket Angus Fraser said: "Sam's cricket has developed considerably in the last three years and he is now one of the leading top order batsmen in LV= County Championship Division One."This progress and quality has been recognised by England who have selected him to be involved in this winter's Performance Programme. The selection is richly deserved."Sam is a top bloke with a fantastic attitude. The way he plays and approaches his cricket is first-class."Sam is the sort of cricketer Middlesex CCC wants playing for them and hopefully he will play a leading role in the club achieving its goal of challenging for and winning trophies."His progress is something Middlesex CCC are extremely proud of, and his selection this winter highlights the club's ability to produce international and potential international cricketers."At present Robson would still be able to play for Australia but has spoken in the past about his desire to play for England.
