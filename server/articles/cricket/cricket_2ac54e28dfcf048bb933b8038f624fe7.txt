England Women suffered a 'super over' defeat to the West Indies in a dress rehearsal for Saturday's Twenty20 Tri-Series final.Both sides had posted 118-7 from their allotted overs in the final pool encounter, taking the game to a one-over shootout.And while England could only manage 6-1 from their six balls, Deandra Dottin took advantage to smash the Windies to victory.Dottin had also impressed as West Indies had set the early pace in Bridgetown, plundering 26 off 12 balls.Stafanie Taylor had top-scored for the hosts with 40 off 43, while Jenny Gunn was the pick of the England bowlers as she claimed 2-12.Lydia Greenway had looked to put England into a strong position in reply, with 36 coming off 27 deliveries before she was run out.England lost the wickets of Gunn and Natalie Sciver in the final over, though, and they needed a scampered three from Danielle Hazell off the final ball to force the super over.England will now look to avenge the defeat when they face the Windies in Saturday's final.
