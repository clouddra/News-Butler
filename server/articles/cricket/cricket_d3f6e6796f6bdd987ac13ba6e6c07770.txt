Former England international Chris Read will be staying at Nottinghamshire for another two years after signing a new contract.However, the wicket-keeper is to stand down as captain in the shorter formats of the game after leading the side to a first limited overs trophy in 22 years in the Yorkshire Bank 40 event last summer.The 35-year-old will remain in charge in the LV= County Championship and hopes his batting form will improve in 2014."My focus at the end of last season was on winning a one-day trophy and avoiding relegation, so I felt the need to take a couple of weeks to reflect before considering a way forward for myself and the team," said Read in a statement."I demand a lot from myself and I wasn't happy with my batting in the Championship last season, although I felt that I kept wicket to a high standard."I always thought that captaincy was something that I would take on for a few years before handing over the reins. Stepping away from it in limited overs cricket is the start of me doing that."Stephen Fleming was incredibly helpful when I began to take on the role here and I will be similarly supportive to the new limited overs captain."Nottinghamshire have not announced who will succeed Read as skipper but a website statement said: "The new limited overs captain is yet to be confirmed, although James Taylor and Michael Lumb were previously identified as the leading candidates."Nottinghamshire hope to conclude the signing of an overseas bowler and an established batsman in the coming weeks."Read added: "It's important to look forward to next season and to make plans for improvement. We've targeted some players with excellent track records and I'm confident that they can improve us."
