Former Australia paceman Craig McDermott will make his return to the coaching set-up of the national side ahead of the Ashes series with England.McDermott surprisingly resigned from his role as Australia's bowling coach in May 2012.But Cricket Australia has announced the Queenslander will come back into the fold as Test bowling coach, just in time to impart his wisdom ahead of the clash with England, with the first Test starting in Brisbane next month."I'm very happy to be in a position to join the Australian coaching set-up again and I look forward to working closely with (team coach) Darren Lehmann, (captain) Michael Clarke and the team this summer," McDermott said."There is obviously a huge focus on regaining the Ashes this summer and I'll work as hard as possible to prepare our bowlers for the challenge ahead."McDermott will once again link up with the likes of Ryan Harris, Mitchell Johnson and Peter Siddle as Australia attempt to wrest the urn from England's grip.The 48-year-old, who took 291 wickets in 71 Tests, stood down from his post last year citing a busy schedule.But Ali de Winter, who was appointed as Australia's bowling coach last August, will now take charge of the one-day international and Twenty20 set-ups to lighten the load on McDermott.General manager of team performance Pat Howard said: "Appointing coaches to specific roles is something the team performance department has been considering for some time."Given the amount of cricket played now in all three forms of the game, we've been considering our coaching structure to get the best out of the players across the various formats."Lehmann welcomed the decision, adding: "It's great that Craig is now in a position to be involved again and also means we are able to allow Ali to focus on the limited overs formats ahead of the ICC World T20 and 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup which are coming up quickly."
