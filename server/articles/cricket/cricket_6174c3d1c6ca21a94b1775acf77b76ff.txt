Women's Twenty20 tri-series, Bridgetown:England 125-8 (20 overs) beat New Zealand 106 (20 overs) by 19 runsMatch scorecard    Natalie Sciver became the first England player to take a Twenty20 international hat-trick as they beat New Zealand by 19 runs in Barbados to book their place in the final of their T20 tri-series.
    Danielle Wyatt top-scored with 37 as England made 125-8 batting first.
    The White Ferns were all out for 106, despite skipper Suzie Bates's 46, as Jenny Gunn took 5-18 and Sciver 4-21.
    England will now face hosts West Indies in their last round-robin game on Thursday and again in Saturday's final.
    Vice-captain Gunn led the side in the absence of skipper Charlotte Edwards, who was ruled out with a muscle strain.
    With opener Bates anchoring the New Zealand innings, a close finish looked in prospect after she and Sophie Devine (25) had steered them to 74-1 in the 14th over when the latter fell to a return catch by Sciver.
    But when Bates fell to Gunn to leave the White Ferns 97-4, needing 29 from the last 15 balls, it was Sciver's turn to shine - after she had made 23 from 21 balls with the bat.

    Fellow seamer Gunn then took three wickets in the last over to record her best bowling figures for England in any format.
    With New Zealand already eliminated, Thursday's game will serve as a warm-up for the final, with England looking to bounce back after 
    
losing to the Windies by 11 runs earlier this week.
