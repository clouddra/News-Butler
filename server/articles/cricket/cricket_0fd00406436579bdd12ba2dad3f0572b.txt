Monimul Haque's second century of the series helped shift the momentum of the second Test in favour of Bangladesh on day four against New Zealand in Dhaka.Monimul's unbeaten 126 saw the hosts reach stumps well-placed on 269-3 and with a lead of 114 over the Black Caps, who had earlier been bowled out for 437 in their first innings.Sharing a record 157-run third-wicket partnership with Tamim Iqbal, who himself posted 70, 22-year-old left-hander Monimul helped wipe out a first-innings deficit of 155 and put the Tigers on course for a drawn series heading into the final day.Starting day four on 419-8, Ish Sodhi was run out for 58 and Trent Boult lbw to Abdur Razzak for four, but BJ Watling's unbeaten 70 meant that New Zealand had opened up a significant advantage.Bangladesh did not start well in reply, either, losing Anamul Haque with the total on 39 and Marshall Ayub 16 runs later.Anamul had scored 22 when he went after a full delivery from Neil Wagner outside off stump and edged to Peter Fulton at first slip who took a low catch.Ayub also fell to Wagner, for nine runs, attempting to drive outside off stump and again getting an edge to the slips where Ross Taylor took the catch.But Tamim, the Bangladesh top scorer in the first innings with 95 out of a total of 282, added 157 alongside the irrepressible Monimul to frustrate the New Zealanders.Tamin fell on 70 when he produced a thick edge off spinner Kane Williamson and Taylor pulled off a stunning one-handed catch above his head.But Monimul stood firm alongside Shakib Al-Hasan (32no), who had earlier finished with 5-103, to leave both sides running out of time to force a series-clinching win.
