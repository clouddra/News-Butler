    For many a year, the only Ashes spinner worthy of mention was a portly blond Australian who went by the name of Shane.
    Time after time, Warne picked apart England's batting order with surgical precision during a period of near-unblemished Australia dominance.

    Now, with England firmly on top in cricket's oldest rivalry, it is they who boast comfortably the most influential spin bowler on either side.
    In fewer than five years of Test cricket, Graeme Swann, 34, has taken 248 wickets, including 26 in England's 3-0 Ashes victory last summer - their third consecutive triumph over Australia.
    Off the field, he is England's 
    
most charismatic cricketer since Andrew Flintoff  

     - a natural showman and practical joker whose 
    
quirky video diaries  

     during the 2010-11 Ashes attracted more than a million online views.
    On the eve of his fourth Ashes series, BBC Sport has been tracing Swann's life from childhood, speaking to those who know him best and have influenced him through his career.
    Together they paint a picture of a man whose appetite for fun and frolics belies a steely determination to drain every last drop from his talent.
    The sons of a PE teacher and amateur cricketer, Graeme and older brother Alec were indoctrinated in the joys of leather on willow from an early age during their upbringing in the environs of Northampton.
    "Dad used to play at a club called the Old Northamptonians," recalls 
    
Alec, who played 77 first-class matches  

     for Northamptonshire and Lancashire as a batsman between 1996 and 2004.
    "We would just tag along with our bat and ball. There was so much space that we could be left to our own devices.
    "We would spend all day in the nets behind the sightscreen. He'd bowl at me, I'd bowl at him and once dad was out and had calmed down he'd come and chuck it around with us too. We'd do that every Saturday and a few Sundays, making sure we were home to mum once it was time for tea.
    "When we weren't playing sport, Graeme was hyperactive. He was unable to sit still for any length of time and had a very short attention span.
    "His extrovert character came out when we went to secondary school. I was a couple of years older than him and if he ever saw me he would always be taking the mickey out of me and my mates. He was never shy in making a comment here and there about girls or whatever it may be. 
    "In class he liked to give the impression that he wasn't too fussed, and if there was ever a comment to be made he'd be the one making it. 
    "By the time he was 15 he had made up his mind that cricket was what he wanted to do."
