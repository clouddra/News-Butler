Glamorgan have confirmed they will not be offering former England paceman Simon Jones a contract for the 2014 season.Jones retired from first-class and List A cricket last season, opting to focus on the shortest format of the game, and he hoped to stay with his home county next summer.But managing director Hugh Morris confirmed he would not be in their plans and Jones will have to look elsewhere - Gloucestershire are reportedly interested in the 34-year-old."I am bitterly disappointed that nothing has been offered," Jones said. "I am a local boy and I thought when I came back from Hampshire I would finish my career here."The support I have had from the players and fans has been excellent and I wish them all the best in the future. I felt I could have offered a lot more on but it was not to be."And Morris admitted the decision had been a tough one to come to, saying: "These are always really difficult decisions to take, particularly with players who have performed so outstandingly well for you over a period of time."Simon has had an outstanding career for Glamorgan and for England. In his pomp, looking back to 2005, I think he was one of the best bowlers in the world. It gives Simon the opportunity to look elsewhere."I'm sure there will be a number of clubs and a number of countries that will be looking for his services, particularly in the Twenty20 format of the game and clearly we wish him all the very best with that."
