England Women were stunned by teenage leg-spinner Shaquana Quintyne as they crashed to an 11-run defeat to the West Indies in their Tri-Nations Twenty20 clash in Bridgetown.England were well on course to follow up their opening win over New Zealand with another victory when they cruised to 82-1 in their pursuit of 141.But the 17-year-old Quintyne decimated England's batting line-up to claim impressive figures of 5-16 as the tourists stuttered to 129-8.Captain Charlotte Edwards and Lauren Winfield were rarely troubled in an opening stand of 69 before Quintyne entered the attack and bowled Winfield for 36.The teenager then removed Edwards for 39 in her next over before claiming the further scalps of Natalie Sciver and Sarah Taylor in the same over.Danielle Hazell (17 not out) and Holly Colvin (18no) led a late recovery, but England had already fallen too far behind the asking rate to threaten the West Indies 140-6.Hazell was the pick of England's bowlers as she claimed 3-19, while opener Stafanie Taylor top-scored for the host nation with a measured 40 from 47 balls.Kyshona A Knight (28), Deandra Dottin (32) and Stacy-Ann King (24) also made important contributions down the order to ensure a competitive total.
