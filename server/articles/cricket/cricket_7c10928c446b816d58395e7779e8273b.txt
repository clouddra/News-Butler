The International Cricket Council is set to review the five-year ban handed to Pakistan bowler Mohammad Amir for spot-fixing.Amir, 21, was suspended over his part in a plot to bowl no-balls during the 2010 Lord's Test against England.The sanction is now set to be reviewed by the ICC Board 'in due course' after coming up for discussion during their last board meeting of 2013 in London this weekend.But any final decision on reducing Amir's ban - which is currently due to end in 2015 - will not be taken until the ICC has adopted its new anti-corruption code, which could be as early as January.An ICC statement read: "The ICC Board was informed that a revised version of a more robust and strengthened ICC anti-corruption code will be submitted for discussion/approval at the January 2014 meeting."During the discussion, the matter of Mohammad Amir's five-year ban also came up for discussion."The ICC board decided to review the matter in due course after the revised ICC anti-corruption code has been finalised and adopted."Amir, who spent three months in prison after pleading guilty to the charges, has not been able to train formally but reports in Pakistan suggested a plea would also be made to allow him to resume work at the National Centre in Lahore, possibly also playing in some domestic cricket.
