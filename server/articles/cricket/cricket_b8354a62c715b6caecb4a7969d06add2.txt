Richie Benaud, the commentator and former Australia captain, is recovering in hospital after being involved in a car crash.The 83-year-old was driving home to the Sydney suburb of Coogee by himself when the accident occurred on Wednesday evening - with Benaud suffering chest and shoulder injuries.A statement on the Facebook page of his employer Channel Nine said Benaud's vehicle mounted a verge before crashing into a brick wall. Police attended the incident but no charges were laid."No one else was injured, and I was more worried about the car than myself," Benaud said, referring to his prized 1963 Sunbeam Alpine.Nine Entertainment chief executive officer David Gyngell added: "Richie is a national treasure. In the Nine family, he sits at the head of the table."As always he and (wife) Daphne have our support and Richie will return to call the coming Ashes series against England - his 36th summer in Nine's Wide World of Sports commentary box - when he is good and ready."Former spin bowler Benaud is one of the world's most recognisable commentators having been involved in broadcasting for over 50 years.
