Essex fast bowler Tymal Mills has been summoned by England to help the batsmen prepare for the Ashes.With in-form Mitchell Johnson tipped to be included in the Australia squad, England want a left-arm fast bowler to test the batsmen in the nets.The tourists have packed the squad with tall fast bowlers, but none are left-armers.Mills, 21, was due to fly to Australia anyway as part of the England Performance Programme's winter tour but will now depart earlier than expected.He will leave on Sunday to join England's Test squad in Perth. Mills tweeted: "Very exciting/busy few days/weeks ahead!!! Flying off to Aus on Sunday to help The England side with their prep for the ashes!"Graeme Swann can testify to Mills' pace -  the youngster rapped him on the forearm in a warm-up match and there were fears the spinner may have suffered a break only for X-rays to reveal heavy bruising.
