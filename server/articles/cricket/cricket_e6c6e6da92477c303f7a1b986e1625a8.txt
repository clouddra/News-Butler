    Stafanie Taylor made 40 at the top of the order, while Deandra Dottin hit three sixes in her 19-ball 32 and Stacy-Ann King smashed 24 off 10 deliveries to add late impetus to the Windies innings.
    In reply, Edwards and Lauren Winfield, whose 36 spanned 25 balls, shared an opening partnership of 69 inside 10 overs, but Quintyne removed both to initiate England's collapse.
    They never recovered from losing Natalie Sciver, Sarah Taylor, Tamsin Beaumont and Gunn in the space of 10 balls, while Hazell and Holly Colvin's unbroken ninth-wicket stand of 36 proved futile.
