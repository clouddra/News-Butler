Simon Kerrigan will remain with Lancashire this winter rather than fly to Australia with the England Performance Programme (EPP).The left-arm spinner will work on his game at Old Trafford under a development programme devised by England and Wales Cricket Board spin bowling coach Peter Such.Kerrigan's confidence took a huge hit as he endured a torrid Test debut in the final Ashes clash at The Oval in August, concending 53 runs from eight wayward overs and not being used in Australia's second innings.The 24-year-old will remain part of the EPP, but he will be coached for two months in Manchester while the rest of the squad spend two weeks each in Brisbane and Perth from later this month.Kerrigan and the rest of the EPP squad will then be considered for selection for the England Lions' tour of Sri Lanka early next year.ECB performance director David Parsons said in a statement: "Simon undertook both winter tour programmes with the EPP and England Lions last winter."After further discussions with both Simon and Lancashire CCC, it has been decided that his career development will be best served by remaining in the UK in the pre-Christmas period."He will remain part of the EPP and will continue to be considered for selection for the England Lions tour of Sri Lanka in the New Year."
