seven-wicket victory 

     two days earlier had given England the advantage after the first match between the sides was 
    
abandoned because of rain.
    In the final fixture of the series, England captain Charlotte Edwards lost the toss and, with her side asked to bat first, got off to a poor start as she was bowled by Tremayne Smartt for six.
    Taylor, with her fifth one-day international century, provided almost all of England's batting threat, with Lauren Winfield the second-highest scorer with 18 as West Indies' Anisa Mohammed took 4-26.
    Taylor fell to the final delivery of the innings, but slow left-armer Colvin more than matched Mohammed to lead England's response with the ball.
    Shaquana Quintyne hit an unbeaten 36 but Jenny Gunn, ODI debutant Natasha Farrant and Danielle Hazell took one wicket apiece.
    Fittingly, player of the series wicketkeeper Taylor was involved in the final act as Subrina Munroe was caught behind off Colvin to seal victory.
