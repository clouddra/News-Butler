Batting coach Dave Houghton has left Derbyshire after becoming the victim of cost cutting at the club.A management review prompted the departure of the 56-year-old, who is recognised as one of Zimbabwe's greatest players and has had spells coaching his country as well as England's batsmen.Houghton was Derbyshire's director of cricket from 2003-07 and, having re-joined them in 2011, helped guide the club to the Division Two County Championship title last year.Head coach Karl Krikken praised Houghton for his "magnificent service". He said: "We have been extremely lucky to have someone with David's experience and everyone who has worked with him will have benefited."Houghton's role was paid for from a specialist coaching fund, but the club have decided they are unable to commit to this again for next season.
