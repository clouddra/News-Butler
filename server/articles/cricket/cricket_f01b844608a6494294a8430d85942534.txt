Bangladesh have recalled pace bowler Mashrafe Mortaza to their squad for the first two of three one-day internationals against New Zealand.Mortaza missed the last two ODI series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe because of an ankle injury."Mashrafe is a senior campaigner and his presence always encourages the side," said selector Habibul Bashar. "He is experienced as well, something which is crucial for our young team."Batsmen Anamul Haque, Naeem Islam and Shamsur Rahman and paceman Shafiul Islam join Mortaza in the side as Bangladesh made changes to the one-day squad that toured Zimbabwe in March-April.Anamul, 20, missed the Zimbabwe tour - which Bangladesh lost 2-1 - because of college exams, while Naeem, Shamsur and Shafiul were not selected.Jahirul Islam and Sajedul Islam were among players from the Zimbabwe tour who were not included in this squad, while Mohammad Ashraful remains suspended for his part in a match-fixing scandal.The first two ODIs will be held at Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on October 29 and 31.Bangladesh and New Zealand will play the final ODI on November 3 in Fatullah, before a one-off Twenty20 match at Sher-e-Bangla on November 6.Squad: Mushfiqur Rahim (captain), Mahmudullah, Anamul Haque, Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan, Nasir Hossain, Abdur Razzak, Sohag Gazi, Rubel Hossain, Mominul Hoque, Naeem Islam, Mashrafe Mortaza, Shafiul Islam, Ziaur Rahman and Shamsur Rahman.
