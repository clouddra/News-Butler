"I know every team tells you when you're winning that there is good camaraderie and all that sort of stuff, but there was a real cohesion in the team."Paul Collingwood"I am enjoying myself; I have one year left on my contract and I would have thought that would be it after that," he told the ECB website.Media work and coaching are both likely to be on the agenda when Collingwood's playing days come to an end.He was recently added to Scotland's coaching staff, and he will spend the winter with them."I have enjoyed the TV stuff more than I thought I would," he said. "I quite enjoy providing in-depth analysis."Coaching is always the role I have always fancied but you have got to experience it, which is why I am doing this job (with Scotland) through the winter."Collingwood, 37, admits winning the County Championship crown this year meant more to him than Durham's previous titles in 2008 and 2009 when, more often than not, he was away with England."It was, yeah. Obviously being captain and having so many homegrown players, too, was great," he said."I know every team tells you when you're winning that there is good camaraderie and all that sort of stuff, but there was a real cohesion in the team."We went through some hard times and adversity with Geoff Cook's illness (the Director of Cricket suffered a heart attack). Every single game we seemed to have an injury or lose a player."There was a long list of things throughout the season that just seemed to gel the team more together really."Once we got the momentum and the confidence it was hard stopping us. Whatever the situation, we just seemed to find a way to win. It was a really special achievement this summer."
