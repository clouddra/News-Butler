South Africa batsman Hashim Amla is unlikely to feature in the second Test against Pakistan.The world No 1 Test batsman has left the United Arab Emirates and returned home to attend the imminent birth of his second child.The second Test starts in Dubai on October 23, and Amla is not expected to return in time.A South Africa team statement read: "Amla flew back to South Africa on Friday morning for the birth of his second child. His wife is expected to give birth soon.Amla made 118 in the first innings of the opening Test in Abu Dhabi, but it was not enough to prevent Pakistan cruising to a surprise seven-wicket victory.But the 30-year-old insists Graeme Smith's side can bounce back and square the series in Dubai next week."We'll probably have a few net sessions, but the biggest change will be mental," Amla said prior to his departure."We know where we went wrong and this team is without a doubt a fantastic team. We take a lot of pride from our performance and this loss hurt, we set high standards for ourselves."The Proteas have announced they will not call up any replacement for Amla if he cannot return in time for the second Test.
