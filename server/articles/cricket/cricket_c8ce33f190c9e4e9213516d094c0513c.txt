    England batsman Jonathan Trott has brushed aside criticism from Darren Lehmann, suggesting the Australia coach has little to shout about after his team's recent 3-0 Ashes defeat.
    Lehmann 
    
described England's cricket as "dour" 

     after losing the summer series.
    He also claimed his team had "made inroads" into Trott's mind ahead of 
    
the return series down under, 

     which starts in Brisbane on 21 November.
    "I'd take another dour 3-0 in Australia," Trott, 32, told BBC Sport.
