South Africa have been dealt a blow as they bid to square the Test series against Pakistan with the news bowling coach Allan Donald has returned home from the United Arab Emirates tour.The former Proteas paceman was "granted leave of absence...for personal family reasons" on Sunday, just three days before the tourists play Pakistan in the second Test in Dubai.High performance coach Vincent Barnes will stand in for Donald and work alongside coach Russell Domingo.South Africa team manager Dr Mohammed Moosajee said: "One of the key characteristics of our environment has been our commitment to making sure our players and management are in a good space both on and off the field."Vinnie has worked closely with Russell and (former coach) Gary (Kirsten) in the past and will no doubt fit in comfortably into the environment."We wish Allan all of the best during this difficult time."The world number one side suffered their first defeat in 15 Tests in the opening match, with Pakistan claiming a comfortable seven-wicket win at Abu Dhabi.
