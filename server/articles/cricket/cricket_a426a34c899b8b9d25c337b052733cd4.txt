    Batsman Jonathan Trott says England will not change the way they play 
    
despite being called "dour" by Australia coach Darren Lehmann.
    Lehamnn has been outspoken about England's style during their 
    
3-0 Ashes victory 

     in the summer but, looking ahead to 
    
the return series down under 

     which begins next month, Trott maintains that winning is what is important.
    The Warwickshire right-hander also makes a passionate defence of the right of South Africa-born players such as himself and Kevin Pietersen, who both have a British parent, to play for England.
