    Middlesex bowler Toby Roland-Jones has had keyhole surgery on a knee injury.
    The 25-year-old seamer has suffered long-standing pain in his right knee and underwent an operation by a Swedish surgeon on Wednesday afternoon.
    The Lord's outfit expect a relatively short time-frame for Roland-Jones' rehabilitation programme.
    The England Lions bowler should be fit to start training in a week's time and he is expected to be fully fit to bowl in around six to eight weeks.
