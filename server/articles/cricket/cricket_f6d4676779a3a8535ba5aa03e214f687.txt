Former Kent, Middlesex and England wicketkeeper Paul Downton has been chosen as the successor to Hugh Morris in the role of Managing Director - England Cricket.Sky Sports commentator and former England captain Andrew Strauss was understood to have been on the shortlist for the job.But he appears keen to spend some time away from the national set-up and Downton has been given the nod instead.The 56-year-old played 30 Tests for England between 1981 and 1988 and also featured in 28 one-day internationals.Downton also played in both the 1981 and 1985 Ashes-winning series, as well as the 1984/5 series victory in India and the Cricket World Cup final in 1987 in Kolkata.He also enjoyed success in the domestic game, including helping Middlesex claim the County Championship and Gillette Cup double in 1980.But Downton was forced to retired from the game after being struck in the eye by a bail during a Sunday League match and he went on to enjoy a successful career in the City.He will officially take over from Morris on 1 February 2014."I am honoured to have been offered this position and the trust which the ECB has placed in me to lead our national teams," he told their official website."Since retiring from the game I have taken a close interest in both County and International cricket and I am excited by the challenge of building on the success which England teams have enjoyed at all levels in recent years."My discussions during the appointment process have provided me with a clear vision of the importance attached to this role and I look forward to forging close and successful working relationships with my new colleagues at ECB."ECB Chief Executive David Collier is delighted to have Downton on board and feels he is definitely the man for the job."Paul's record of success both on and off the field made him the outstanding candidate to replace Hugh Morris," said Collier."His experience of a World Cup final, Ashes success, six County Championship wins and 58 international appearances for England provides a wealth of cricket experience."His background in law when coupled with his experience in the City provides the unique set of skills which is required to lead and manage the England Cricket Department's Â£100million budget over the next four years."Paul will inherit a thriving Team England operation which has been exceptionally well led by Hugh Morris and the ECB wishes Hugh every success in his new role at Glamorgan CCC."
