    When Monty Panesar fell from grace in an 
    
altercation with some Brighton bouncers, 

     he found himself 
    
unwanted by Sussex, 

     with his career seemingly headed for the rocks.
    His cricket had always been effervescent and innocent. Now there were images of him on YouTube being wrestled by doormen and he just didn't seem the same man. It looked like the outward expression of inner insecurities, helped along by a couple of drinks.
    Panesar turned to 
    
Neil Burns at London County Cricket ClubÂ  

     and things are finally looking on the up for him. He was named in England's squad for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia and flew out with the rest of the squad earlier this week.
    Burns describes his organisation as "part cricket club, part mentoring body". He had worked with Panesar before, starting in 2008, and their relationship is based on trust, meaning much of their work remains a matter of confidence.
    But Burns has spoken to me about his own working philosophy.
