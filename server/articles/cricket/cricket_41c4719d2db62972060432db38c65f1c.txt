The second Test between Bangladesh and New Zealand ended in a draw after the final day in Dhaka was completely washed out.The covers did come off briefly in the morning and there was some hope of play after an early lunch was taken at 11am local time, but the heavens opened again and the umpires called off the match just after 2pm.Bangladesh had been dismissed for 282 in their first innings, with Neil Wagner taking 5-64, and an impressive 116 from Corey Anderson handed New Zealand a lead of 155.The home side hit back, though, and Mominul Haque was unbeaten on 126 at the close of day four to help the Tigers reach 269-3, a lead of 114 with seven wickets left.The two-match series ended 0-0 after the first Test at Chittagong also ended in a draw.
