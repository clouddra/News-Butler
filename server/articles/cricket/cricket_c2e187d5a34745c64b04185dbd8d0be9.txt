November 5, 2013, 11:00pmAnd while Cook, who led England to a 3-0 success over their greatest rivals this summer, claims 'he will not lose any sleep over the comments', he is aware he could be a bit more adventurous in his approach.Speaking to Sky Sports News, Cook, who has lost just one Test match in 14 since taking over the captaincy from Andrew Strauss in August 2012, said: "I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty of my captaincy. I'm not sure that's really what this is all about."This is what happens when England play Australia. It happened in the summer and I don't expect anything to change over the next couple of months."I have always said I am trying to learn my job, trying to learn from experience, and I'm sure there are times when I could be slightly more imaginitive and think slightly differently if the situation arises."But we have had a pretty good run so far as a Test side."In my first year as a Test captain we won away in India, which hadn't been done for a long time, we won a series against Australia and I think they are things which we can be very proud of as a side.




"There is a lot more interest in what is going on in the game today, and how you handle yourself, and over a pretty long period now I think I have handled it pretty well."

"He is a fantastic player and I think anyone who saw his 180 at Lord's and his 100 against New Zealand will have seen the class he has."He has been outstanding for us in all forms of the game and being able to bat in any situation is one of his greatest strengths."You can see England's next warm-up match against Australia 'A' live from 11pm on Tuesday on Sky Sports 2 HD.
