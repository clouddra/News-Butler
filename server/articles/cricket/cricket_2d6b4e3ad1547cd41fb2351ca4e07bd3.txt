    Northants all-rounder David Willey has signed to play for Auckland Aces in New Zealand's domestic Twenty20 tournament.
    Willey will miss the first three matches of the competition, which runs between 1 November and 18 January 2014, but will be available thereafter.
    Auckland have also signed Australian batsman Brad Hodge, Sussex all-rounder Luke Wright and Gloucestershire fast bowler James Fuller.
    "Each gives us something different," said Auckland coach Matt Horne.
    Willey enjoyed a superb season in all forms of cricket for Northants in 2013, and was named man of the match when the 
    
Steelbacks thrashed Surrey 

     in the final of the FLt20 in August.
