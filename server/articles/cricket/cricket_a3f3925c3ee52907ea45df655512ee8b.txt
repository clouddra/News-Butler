    Kent wicketkeeper Geraint Jones tells BBC Radio Kent that, in terms of his own performance, the 2013 season was his worst for the club.
    The 37-year-old was dropped for the start of the FLt20, scored only 403 runs in the County Championship and was replaced by Sam Billings for the final two four-day games.
    Jones says he faces "a shoot-out" with Billings in pre-season to see who will keep wicket for the county in 2014.
