    Essex left-arm seamer Tymal Mills will fly to Australia to provide practice for the England batsmen in the Ashes series, which begins on 21 November.
    Mills, 21, was due to travel down under for the England Performance Programme's winter tour but will now go on Sunday.

    Mills 
    
hit England spinner Graeme Swann on the forearm 

     during a warm-up match for this summer's Ashes in July.
    He consistently bowls at 90mph and there were initially concerns Swann had suffered a serious injury - but scans revealed nothing more than heavy bruising and he was able to play all five Tests against Australia, finishing as the leading wicket-taker with 26.
    "Very exciting/busy few days/weeks ahead!!!" 
    
Mills tweeted.Â 
    Johnson took 15 wickets in four Tests when England last visited Australia in 2010-11, including a match haul of 9-82 in a 
    
267-run win for the home side 

     in the third Test in Perth.
    The Australians are in India for a seven-match one-day international series and both Johnson and Faulkner have taken five wickets in the four matches played so far.
    Faulkner made his 
    
Test debut 

     at The Oval in August and took 4-51 and 2-47 in a draw that 
    
secured England a 3-0 series win, 

     their third successive triumphant Ashes campaign.
    Mitchell Starc is a third left-arm quick bowler in the Australia ranks, but he 
    
could miss the Ashes 

     because of a back injury.
    Mills took six Championship wickets in five Division Two matches last season and played for England Lions against Bangladesh A at Taunton, taking 0-59 from eight overs.
    England's first match of the tour starts on Thursday in Perth against a Western Australia XI.
