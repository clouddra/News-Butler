A fifth one-day international century from Sarah Taylor helped England's women to secure a series victory over the West Indies with an 89-run win in Trinidad.Taylor scored a blistering 100 from just 108 balls to help England to make 185 all out in their 50 overs, before left-arm spinner Holly Colvin took 4-17 to help dismiss the Windies for just 96 in only 36.4 overs.After the first game of the three-match series was washed out, England won by seven wickets two days earlier and then their win in the final game saw them become the first women's team to win a series in the West Indies.Captain Charlotte Edwards was bowled for just six by Tremayne Smartt after losing the toss and being asked to bat first by the hosts.Anisa Mohammed took 4-26 and although England's next best score was Lauren Winfield's 18, Taylor stood firm to drag England to a competitive total - only being removed on the final ball of the innings.Shaquana Quintyne hit an unbeaten 36 in response for the West Indies, but without any lingering help it was never going to be enough to help them get even close to England's target.England now turn their attentions to January when they look to retain the Ashes against Australia.
