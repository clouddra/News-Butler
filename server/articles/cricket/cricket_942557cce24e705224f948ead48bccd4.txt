David Warner smashed the highest one-day score in Australian domestic cricket history by hammering 197 off 144 balls for New South Wales.Warner was left out of Australia's one-day squad for the tour of India and his international career is up in the air ahead of the Ashes series with England which starts next month.But his sensational knock, in the semi-finals of the Ryobi Cup against Victoria, hit the headlines in Australia and gave the selectors a timely reminder of his talents.He was finally dismissed when he was caught on the boundary going for the six which would have seen him become the first man to score a domestic limited-overs double century.But his innings - which included 20 fours and 10 sixes - eclipsed the previous best of 187 by Jimmy Maher scored for Queensland against Western Australia in 2004.With three centuries in four matches in the competition, Warner has accumulated 527 runs at an average of 75 - a run of form that will not have been missed by selectors with the first Ashes Test less than a month away.Warner's innings on Thursday helped New South Wales to victory by four wickets and they will play Queensland in the final on Sunday."It's amazing how the table turns," Warner told the Sydney Morning Herald. "You're only three hundreds away from playing at the next level."While Warner's run of form has come in the 50-over game, he believes he can translate it to the longer format."You know your cues, my cues out there are being still and that's working for me now," he said."There's no reason why that can't work for me in the Test arena. We've got three Shield games coming up, hopefully I can keep repeating my efforts here and help NSW win those games."
