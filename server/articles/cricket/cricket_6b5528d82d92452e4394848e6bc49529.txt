Pakistan have levelled the one-day series against South Africa at 1-1 after beating the Proteas by 66 runs in a low-scoring encounter in Dubai.Ahmed Shehzad was the only player in the match to pass 30 as Pakistan successfully defended 209, Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Irfan sharing six wickets as AB de Villiers' men folded to 143 in reply.Shehzad's 58 at the top of the order was Pakistan's best individual effort by a distance as they were dismissed in the final over, all-rounder Ryan McLaren claiming four wickets.Misbah-ul-Haq opted to bat first having won the toss but South Africa, who won the opening match of the series by one run in thrilling fashion on Wednesday, struck early when Morne Morkel had Nasir Jamshed well caught by Lonwabo Tsotsobe for one in the third over.After the 10-over powerplay, Shehzad and Mohammad Hafeez had taken the score to 40-1 but Hafeez could not kick on and was bowled off the inside edge by McLaren for 26 in 32 balls.That brought Misbah to the crease and in the 23rd over he lifted JP Duminy for the first six of the day while two balls later Shehzad worked a single off the spinner to reach his half-century in 67 balls.Having added 60 for the third wicket, both batsmen then fell in consecutive overs.Misbah hacked McLaren straight to midwicket for 25 and Shehzad's anchor role ended when he fed Saeed Ajmal a return catch.Pakistan took the powerplay in the 36th over with Umar Amin and Umar Akmal together at 143-4 but the period saw the bowlers reclaim control.Pakistan scored just 12 for the loss of both men, Akmal dismissed by Morkel and Amin becoming McLaren's third victim.The mercurial Afridi briefly shone with four boundaries in his 26, but after he fell to Morkel the Proteas wrapped up the innings efficiently with two balls to spare.South Africa would have backed themselves to top 209, even in tough batting conditions, but could not get a grip on the bowling and were rolled over for 143 with 56 balls left to bowl.Pakistan were in control throughout the second innings, though, with spinners Hafeez and Ajmal bowling a combined 18 overs for just 40 runs as well as taking three wickets.The chase got off to a shaky start when Colin Ingram was castled by a quick inswinger from Sohail Tanvir in the second over.But after the 10-over powerplay Graeme Smith and JP Duminy had taken the score to 37-1- just three short of Pakistan's mark at the same stage.But when Hafeez and Ajmal began to turn the screw with some tight bowling, Smith tried to sweep his way out of trouble and was cleaned up by Ajmal.Just five balls later Duminy was following him back to the pavilion having nicked the returning Irfan to slip for 25.New man Faf du Plessis saw two nicks drop short on nought but captain Villiers was next to go, Afridi winning an lbw decision with his first delivery.That left the Proteas struggling on 66-4 in the 23rd over and that became 73-5 when Du Plessis became Afridi's second victim courtesy of a fine edge.The last of the specialist batsmen, David Miller, made just 11 before Hafeez had him leg before, leaving all-rounders Wayne Parnell and McLaren an unlikely salvage job.They made 50 runs between them but never caught up with the rate and when Parnell was dismissed by Irfan the tail subsided to leave McLaren stranded.Afridi struck the final blow, Imran Tahir stumped by Umar Akmal.
