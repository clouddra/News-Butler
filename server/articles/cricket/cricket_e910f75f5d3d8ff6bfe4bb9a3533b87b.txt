Leicestershire have awarded new contracts to Anthony Ireland, Angus Robson, James Sykes and Tom Wells.Sykes has signed a new two-year deal which keeps him at Grace Road until the end of the 2015 campaign, and the others have been extended for next season.Fast bowler Ireland, who joined the Foxes from Middlesex last year, was restricted through the season by injuries, but when he was fit he made a big impact.He was the club's leading wicket-taker in the Friends Life twenty20 with 15 and also returned some useful performances in the YB40.Slow left-armer Sykes picked up a four-wicket haul on his Championship debut and gained valuable experience stepping in for the injured Jigar Naik.Robson had a fine season in the 2XI and scored 49 in his second innings for the first team, and Wells made a huge impact after coming into the side late in the season.All-rounder Wells made three quickfire contributions in the YB40 without being dismissed, scoring 88 runs off just 43 balls in those innings. He then made an excellent 82 Hampshire in the Championship on the final day of the season.
