                        The England team have been backing captain Alastair Cook, after Shane Warne labelled him as negative, boring and not very imaginative.                    England take on Australia 'A' in Hobart - the home side will feature batsman Alex Doolan who is looking to force his way into Australia's Ashes plans after scoring a century for Tasmania in the Sheffield Shield last week.Usman Khawaja and Sean Marsh are also both in the Australia side - the pair are in contention for the number six spot in the Test side."It was decent opposition in Perth last week but this will be a tougher test for us in Hobart this week and I'm looking forward to it," he told Sky Sports News."I think we were probably a bit rusty in the first innings of the first game, we were just trying to find our feet."We had a week's preparation before that but there's nothing like getting out in the middle and playing in match conditions."I thought in the second innings, the guys bowled brilliantly so hopefully we can use that as a platform and improve in this game."England v Australia 'A' is live from 11pm on Tuesday on Sky Sports 2 HD.
