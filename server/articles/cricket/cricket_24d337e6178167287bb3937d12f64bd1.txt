Kent have released veteran fast bowler Charlie Shreck, whilst batsman Alex Blake has been given a new one-year contract.Shreck joined Kent from Nottinghamshire in 2012, and took 55 wickets in his first season.The 35-year-old took 31 in all formats this season, the third highest wicket-taker at the club. But with Kent having signed David Griffiths from Hampshire and Mitch Claydon from Durham to boost their fast bowling options for next season, the giant Cornishman has been released.Shreck told the Kent Messenger: "My two years playing for Kent have been a unique experience which I will not forget. I'd like to thank the purists that made the effort to watch and support the longer form of the game."Kent's chairman of cricket Graham Johnson said: "I would like to thank Charlie for his commitment on the field and efforts for the club over the last two years. We all wish him well with the next stage of his career."Blake, 24, made a big impact when he burst on to the scene in 2008, but has found it difficult to break into the first team since, and did not play a single game in the County Championship this season.Blake said: "I'm happy to have signed my contract - this gives me a great opportunity to push on, and push for a first team spot."I'm really pleased that the club have shown faith in me and I intend to repay that next season, by working hard towards higher accolades with the club."Johnson said: "Having shown he can play at 2nd XI level, we have confidence in his ability to show the form he showed at times in the first team during 2013 on a more consistent basis in all forms of the game in 2014."
