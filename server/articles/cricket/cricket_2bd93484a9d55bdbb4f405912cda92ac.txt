Glamorgan spinner Dean Cosker has agreed a new two-year contract with the county.The 35-year-old slow left-armer, who made his first-class debut back in 1996, had been concerned about his future earlier in the year with his previous contract due to expire at the end of the 2013 season.However, he has now agreed a deal to extend his at the Swalec Stadium which will mean he will have completed 20 years of service by 2015.Cosker said: "I love taking wickets for Glamorgan and there is no feeling like it so I'm pleased to commit myself to Glamorgan for another two years. I am a Welsh lad and am proud and honoured to be playing for this Club, which is on the up."The appointment of Hugh Morris has played a significant part in this decision. I have huge respect for Hugh and he is highly respected within the game."He has been very influential with the way England have been successful over the last few years, so it is exciting times to have a Glamorgan legend back at the club, to see the young talent coming through and the elements of a good team coming together."Cosker, who was a member of the Glamorgan side which won the County Championship in 1997, has taken 547 first-class wickets and scored 3,017 runs for Glamorgan as well as taking 240 List A wickets and 68 Twenty20 wickets as a key member of their one-day sideHe follows Jim Allenby, Mark Wallace and Michael Hogan in signing new deals with Glamorgan.
