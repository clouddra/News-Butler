Bowling coach David Saker claims England will welcome the revival of Hotspot for their Ashes series in Australia, if the technology aid is given the go-ahead after all.There have been doubts that the thermal-imaging method, which caused so much controversy in a vexed series at home to Australia last summer, would not be available for the rematch.But with less than three weeks to the first Test in Brisbane, reports suggest not only Hotspot but a real-time 'Snicko' - a second means by which bat-on-ball contact is detected - may yet be available.

November 5, 2013, 11:00pmAnd echoing several similar statements made by coach Andy Flower last summer, Saker said: "I think if we can get as many correct decisions as possible, it's better for the game - not just for England."The decision obviously will be made by Cricket Australia, but I'd definitely welcome it for sure."Saker insists he has not lost faith in the accuracy of Hotspot, despite the confusion which often surrounded its implementation in the five-match series - won 3-0 by the hosts."Obviously over the English summer, a few things went a little wrong with it," he added. "But the majority of the time, they've got more decisions right than wrong - so I'm a big supporter of it."Meanwhile, Saker is expecting Boyd Rankin, Steven Finn and Chris Tremlett to raise their performances as the Tourists continue their preparations.Their first opportunity in the middle may be against Australia A in Hobart in a four-day match starting on Wednesday, when possibly two of the trio will have a chance to win over the selectors.Assessing the various merits of the three hopefuls, Saker said: "From where I sit, it's exciting. I'm sure it isn't from where they sit."But it's always good having competition for spots because then you get probably the best out of everyone. If all of them bowl at their maximum, it's going to be a hell of a hard selection."Who will be England's leading wicket-taker in the forthcoming Ashes series in Australia?
