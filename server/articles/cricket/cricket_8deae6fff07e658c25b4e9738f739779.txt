England seamer Stuart Broad has signed a three-year contract extension with Nottinghamshire.The 27-year-old plays little county cricket as he is centrally contracted to the England and Wales Cricket Board.But he has committed to Notts until the end of the 2016 season, and his deal at Trent Bridge will become full time if he loses his place in the England side.Broad said: "It's been a massive year for me. It started with winning The Ashes, and ended with bringing home the Yorkshire Bank 40 trophy to Nottingham."I'm really looking forward to the next three years and bringing more success to Trent Bridge."Broad moved to Notts from Leicestershire in 2008 and has taken 78 wickets, including 15 in three games this summer.Director of cricket Mick Newell said: "Stuart is an excellent player and asset to this club."To have someone of his quality available to us at certain points in the season gives us an extra edge, and he was influential in securing the Yorkshire Bank 40 trophy for us at Lord's."Broad took three for 29 as his side hammered Glamorgan by 87 runs in September 21's 40-over final.
