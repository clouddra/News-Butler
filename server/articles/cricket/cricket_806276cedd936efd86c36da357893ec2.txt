Steve Waugh has laughed off any suggestions that Shane Warne's comments will have a negative affect on Alastair Cook's performance in the forthcoming Ashes series.Former Australia spinner Warne claimed Cook's 'boring and negative tactics' could cost England victory this winter and that he has to be 'more imaginative like rival skipper Michael Clarke'.Cook hit back at Warne claiming his record of one Test defeat in 14 speaks for itself, and Waugh has backed the England skipper claiming he enjoys the full support of the travelling party."I think as a captain you do the job you have to do. England won 3-0 in the summer and you can't argue with that," Waugh told Sky Sports News."As long as your own players respect you - and I think the England players respect Alastair Cook - then I'm sure that's all he is concerned about."The comments from Shane will be water off a duck's back. Alastair will just go out a do his job and if his side is winning then there's not much else he can do."Waugh, who captained Australia to 15 of their record-breaking 16 successive Tests wins, and to victory in the 1999 World Cup, believes this winter's series will be much closer than England's 3-0 summer success on home soil."I think it will be a tough series for both sides and I think a lot will depend on the injury situation," he said."Key injuries to key players may sway the result in favour of the opposition but I think England will probably go in slight favourites"They've won the last three Ashes while Australia don't quite know their batting ahead of the first Test. That gives England an edge but I think it will be 2-2."
