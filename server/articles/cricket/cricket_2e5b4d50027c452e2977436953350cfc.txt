                        England's top order confident                    The Yorkshire opener has found his place at the top of the innings under scrutiny following a mixed Ashes series in the summer.Root hit a career-high 180 at Lord's, however he registered just one other half-century in 10 innings against Australia, averaging 37.66.Legendary leg-spinner Shane Warne has called for Root to be moved to No 6, claiming the 22-year-old could be 'crucified' by Australia's fast bowlers if he remains at the top of the order.However for Root representing his country is more important than where in the line-up he is required.
