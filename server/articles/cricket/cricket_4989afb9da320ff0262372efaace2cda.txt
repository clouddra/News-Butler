    Former Australia fast bowler Craig McDermott has been recalled to coach Darren Lehmann's backroom staff ahead of the winter Ashes series.
    McDermott, 48, quit his job as 
    
Australia's bowling coach 

     last year, but now returns as Test bowling coach.
    The first match of the five-Test series between Australia and England 
    
starts in Brisbane on 21 November.
    McDermott said: "I'll work as hard as possible to prepare our bowlers for the challenge ahead."
    The Queenslander, who took 291 wickets in 71 Tests for Australia between 1984 and 1996, added: "I'm very happy to be in a position to join the Australian coaching set-up again and I look forward to working closely with Darren Lehmann.
    "There is obviously a huge focus on regaining the Ashes this summer."
    McDermott cited a busy schedule as the reason for his departure last May.
    Four months later, he 
    
coached Ireland's bowlers 

     for the World Twenty20.
    Ali de Winter - who was appointed as McDermott's replacement in August 2012 - will look after Australia's bowlers for the one-day and Twenty20 internationals.
    Lehmann believes the split approach will give McDermott more time to help Australia wrestle back the Ashes urn from England, who 
    
retained them 

     this summer with a 
    
3-0 series win.
    "It's great that Craig is now in a position to be involved again," said Lehmann.
    "It also means we are able to allow Ali to focus on the limited overs formats ahead of the ICC World T20 and 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup which are coming up quickly."
