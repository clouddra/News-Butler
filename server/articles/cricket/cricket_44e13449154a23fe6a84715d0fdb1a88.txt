Australia captain Michael Clarke looks set to be fit for the upcoming return Ashes series.Clarke is back in the nets and could play in domestic cricket next week after recovering from the latest recurrence of his back injury.Clarke was ruled out of the one-day international series with India because of the problem and there were serious doubts as to whether he would be fit for the first Ashes Test with England on November 21.But he could play in New South Wales' first match of the Sheffield Shield season, which begins on October 30, although the second match against Victoria the following week is seen as a more realistic target.Australia physio Alex Kountouris said: "Michael is progressing well and recently recommenced batting in the nets."At this stage we are aiming to have him fit to play the second round of the Bupa Sheffield Shield, but we have not ruled out the possibility of him playing the first round of the Shield season if he makes better than expected progress."We'll continue to monitor him closely."Clarke has been suffering with back problems for some time and they affected him during the summer Ashes series in England, forcing him to miss some warm-up and limited-overs matches.
