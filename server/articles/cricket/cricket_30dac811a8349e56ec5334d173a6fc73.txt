Alex Hales has signed a new three-year contract with Nottinghamshire after being given permission to play in the Indian Premier League.The England opener, who currently tops the ICC world rankings in international Twenty20 cricket, had hinted he would become a freelance player if Notts continued to deny their players the chance to feature in the IPL.But Notts have relaxed their stance and agreed to release Hales if he is offered a contract worth at least Â£250,000 from an IPL team over the next three seasons.




"It did cross my mind to go freelance and focus on Twenty20 full-time but I've had time to think and I'm still driven to do well in four-day cricket and to break into England's one-day set-up."
