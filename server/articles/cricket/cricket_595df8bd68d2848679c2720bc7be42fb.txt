    Middlesex opening batsman Sam Robson has signed a new two-year contract with the club, keeping him at Lord's until the end of 2015.
    The 24-year-old scored 1,180 runs in the County Championship at an average of 47.20 last season.
    "Sam's cricket has developed considerably in the last three years," said Middlesex managing director of cricket Angus Fraser.
    "He is now one of the leading top-order batsmen in Division One."

“The way he plays and approaches his cricket is first-class. He has the potential to play international cricket and his progress is something Middlesex are extremely proud of”
    Robson, who made his first-class debut for Middlesex in 2009, was the third-highest run-scorer in the top flight this year and 
    
has been selected to be part of the England performance programme in Australia this winter.
    The Sydney-born right-hander has previously represented Australia at Under-19 level and was able to play in county cricket as a non-overseas player because of his British mother.
    He 
    
qualified to represent England this summer 

     and, despite the possibility of playing internationally for Australia, 
    
he says his future lies with England. 
    Fraser says Rogers' selection by England is "richly deserved" and expects him to be a success in the years to come.
    "Sam is a top bloke with a fantastic attitude," he said.
    "The way he plays and approaches his cricket is first-class.
    "Hopefully he will play a leading role in the club achieving its goal of challenging for and winning trophies. 
    "He has undoubtedly benefitted from working with 
    
Mark Ramprakash 

     and Mark O'Neill [Middlesex's current and former batting coaches].
    "He has the potential to play international cricket. His progress is something Middlesex are extremely proud of.
    "His selection this winter highlights the club's ability to produce international and potential international cricketers."
