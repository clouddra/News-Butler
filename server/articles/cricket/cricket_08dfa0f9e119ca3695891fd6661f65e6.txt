    Scotland vice-captain Preston Mommsen will miss the ICC World Twenty20 qualifiers in Dubai in November.
    Mommsen, who has a pelvis injury, will be replaced with middle-order batsman Craig Wallace, who was a member of the last T20 qualifying campaign in 2012.
    Scotland coach Peter Steindl said: "It's a disappointment to lose a player of Preston's calibre. 
    All matches will be played in the United Arab Emirates.
    "Not only has he been a consistent performer for Scotland in recent times but he has been one of our leaders."
    However, Steindl backed Wallace to be a good replacement.
    "He has worked hard over the last 12 months and has improved as a batsman," said the coach. "He is a good fit to replace Preston."
    Mommsen's withdrawal follows this week's announcement that 
    
Scotland captain Kyle Coetzer had recovered from a wrist injury in time to be named in the squad.
    Scotland's players will depart for a 12 day pre-tournament tour of Sri Lanka on Sunday before taking on the United States and Namibia in two warm-up fixtures in the UAE on 12-14 November.
    They will then begin their quest to reach the 2014 World Twenty20, opening their Group B fixtures against Bermuda on 15 November.
    Kyle Coetzer (capt), Craig Wallace, Richie Berrington, Neil Carter, Matthew Cross, Gordon Goudie, Majid Haq, Moneeb Iqbal, Michael Leask, Matt Machan, Calum MacLeod, David Murphy, Safyaan Sharif, Robert Taylor, Iain Wardlaw.
