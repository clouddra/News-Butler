Pakistan are staring defeat in the face after closing day three of their second Test with South Africa on 132-4 and still 286 runs away from making the Proteas bat again.South Africa were dismissed for 517 in the morning session to lead by a whopping 418 and, after a nightmare start to their reply when they lost both openers in two overs, they ended the day still well behind.Captain Misbah-ul-Haq (42 not out) was alongside Asad Shafiq (28no) at stumps as South Africa dominated a day that was only spoilt as they were docked five runs by the umpires for ball tampering.The controversy came in the final session when umpires Ian Gould and Rod Tucker were forced to change the ball, called skipper Graeme Smith over and applied a five-run penalty after they deemed the condition of the ball had been changed.For a long period the morning session was a face-saving exercise for the nominal hosts, and spinner Saeed Ajmal in particular, as they claimed the Proteas' final six wickets for 57 runs.It was always likely to be in vain due to Pakistan's paltry total of 99 on day one, and the loss of both openers for nought in 11 balls before the break simply confirmed it.Neither of South Africa's overnight centurions kicked on, with both Smith and AB de Villiers adding just seven to their tallies.De Villiers had 164 when he aimed a lavish drive at Mohammad Irfan only to be caught at the wicket by Adnan Akmal, ending a game defining fifth-wicket partnership with his skipper on 338.Smith was unable to build again with Faf du Plessis falling soon after for 234 when he was held at slip pushing at an Ajmal tempter.By then he had faced 388 deliveries and compiled the longest Test innings of the year.Du Plessis hung around longer and brought up the team's 500 when he drilled Zulfiqar Bubar for four, in doing so confirming his side as only the fourth in history to register a first-innings lead of 400 over Pakistan.Pakistan had just two overs to bat out as they came in for their second innings, but lost both openers in that time to go in at 2-2.Younus and Azhar Ali gritted their teeth for 22 overs to prevent an embarrassing collapse as Pakistan built some sort of response, but things still looked bleak for them at the close.
