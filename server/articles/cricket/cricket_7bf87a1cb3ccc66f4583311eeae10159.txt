India reached 27-0 in pursuit of a target of 296 before rain meant the fourth one-day international against Australia in Ranchi ended in a no-result.George Bailey (98) and Glenn Maxwell (92) both narrowly missed out on centuries as Australia - who lead the seven-match series 2-1 - made 295-8 after being invited to bat.But rain arrived 4.1 overs into India's innings and prevented any further play, the umpires ruling the outfield was too wet to allow even a 20-over run chase after the downpour had stopped.

October 26, 2013, 8:45amBailey and Maxwell earlier shared a fourth-wicket stand of 153 after Australia were reduced to 71-4 in the 15th over.Seam bowler Mohammad Shami, making his first appearance of the series in place of the out-of-form Ishant Sharma, removed Aaron Finch (5), Phil Hughes (11) and Shane Watson (14) with the new ball either side of a brief rain break and went on to finish with figures of 3-42.Australia counter-attacked; skipper Bailey slammed seven fours and three sixes in his 94-ball stay, while Maxwell's 77-ball innings featured six fours and five sixes.Bailey top-edged a pull to deep midwicket off Vinay Kumar's bowling two short of his hundred and the seamer also accounted for Maxwell, lbw to one that nipped back, in his haul of 2-52.Rohit Sharma (9no) and Shikhar Dhawan (14no) made a positive start to India's reply before the weather had the final say.The series continues on Saturday in Cuttack.
