INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Former World Cup downhill champion Klaus Kroell has had another operation on the left upper arm he broke after crashing in a super-G in March.The Austrian ski federation says the operation was necessary after Kroell had ongoing problems with his shoulder in his recovery. Kroell says ''a nerve had been damaged. As I don't want to miss the upcoming season, I decided to have surgery again.''Kroell says he will resume training on snow in early November before competing in the first downhill at Lake Louise, Alberta, on Nov. 30. The speed specialist had no plans to start in this month's season-opening giant slalom in Soelden, Austria.Kroell has won six World Cup races and took the season-long downhill title in 2012.
