DENVER (AP) -- ''Mile High'' Mike Alvarado is hoping his title defense doesn't turn from boxing to brawling when the World Boxing Organization junior welterweight champion meets up with Ruslan Provodnikov on Saturday night in Broomfield, Colo.Alvarado knows how dangerous the powerful Russian bruiser is when he's allowed to control the style of fight.The 33-year-old Alvarado said: ''I'm going to stay on my toes and stay on my game. Because with this Russian, you have to be on your toes. You have to be focused, stick to your game plan and not fight his fight.''Alvarado is from the Denver area and will have quite a home-ring advantage at what's expected to be a sold-out 1stBANK Center.
