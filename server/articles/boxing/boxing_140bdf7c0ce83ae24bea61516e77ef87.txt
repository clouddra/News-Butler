Curtis Woodhouse: Scored a convincing points win over Lewis Van PoetschCurtis Woodhouse got back to winning ways as he scored a convincing points victory over Lewis Van Poetsch in Hull on Saturday night.Having been heavily knocked out in four rounds by Derry Matthews in their lightweight bout just six weeks ago, Woodhouse wanted to make a statement back fighting at welterweight.Now being trained by Ryan Rhodes, Woodhouse had promised a more refined style and duly delivered at the Hull Arena as he wore his opponent down to record an ultimately impressive win.Van Poetsch - a serving soldier who has done a tour of duty in Afghanistan - caused his rival some problems early on and landed with a clean overhand right in the second that produced a cut above Woodhouse's left eye.But from that point on the former footballer took charge of proceedings and wore his man down behind an accurate jab.By the end of the fourth blood was streaming from Van Poetsch's nose as Woodhouse found his rhythm and began to catch his man at will.He put him down in the fifth with a punishing body-shot, although Van Poetsch showed great heart to beat the count at eight and make it back to his corner.In the end he survived to hear the final bell, although Woodhouse had proved a class apart and was given a 59-54 verdict by the referee to get his title hopes back on track."It's great to be back, prior to this fight was the most nervous I've ever been because of the demons I had in my mind (following the defeat to Matthews)," Woodhose told Sky Sports afterwards.Earlier, Rendall Munroe comfortably came through his six-round contest against journeyman Latvian Pavel Senkovs.The 'Boxing Binman' was just keeping busy ahead of a prospective European featherweight clash against Lee Selby in the New Year.After clinching a regulation 60-55 over Senkovs, Munroe told Sky Sports: "I did what I had to do. I went out there for a workout, everyone knows that Rendall likes to keep fit."
