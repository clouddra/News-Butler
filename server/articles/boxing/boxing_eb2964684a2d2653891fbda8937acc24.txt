Andrew Selby: Toppled American Malik Jackson to reach the last 16 of the World ChampionshipsAndrew Selby and Paddy Barnes eased into the last 16 of the flyweight competition at the World Amateur Championships in Almaty, Kazakhstan although Josh Taylor is out.The Welsh World No 1, who missed out on the world title by a single point to Russia's Misha Aloian two years ago, won every round against American Malik Jackson to earn a unanimous points win.Belfast's Olympic bronze medallist Barnes marked his move up from light-flyweight with a clear win over Serbian Milos Baltic and shrugged off a small cut sustained during a clash of heads.Barnes said: "It was the first time without headgear and it felt really, really strange. There was a clash of heads and it felt weird, but I'm happy to get the three rounds in."But a head injury accounted for Londoner Charlie Edwards, who was stopped on cuts just one minute into the first round of his bout against Kenyan Simon Nzioki, who goes through to face Barnes instead.There was disappointment for Scotland's Taylor, who lost his light-welterweight bout via a unanimous decision against home favourite Merey Akshalov.
