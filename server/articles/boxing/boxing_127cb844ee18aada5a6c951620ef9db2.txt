Murray subsequently left long-term trainer Joe Gallagher but according to promoter Dave Coldwell - on whose show he returns - is looking forward to re-entering a competitive domestic lightweight division."I'd seen him at a couple of our Manchester shows recently and found out that he was coming back," Coldwell told Sky Sports."I talked to (Murray's promoter) Frank Warren's office and they said it was okay for him to have a run out on our show."I'm not sure where he's at training-wise but I know he's refreshed and itching to get back in the mix."He has seen this lightweight situation with everyone fighting each other and he wants the big fights."I was happy with the show as it is - Liam Hanrahan vs Jamie Speight is a great fight and there are some great prospects on the bill including our big Liverpool prospect Robbie Davies Jr."But John adds that bit extra and we'll get this one out the way and see where we are with him."
