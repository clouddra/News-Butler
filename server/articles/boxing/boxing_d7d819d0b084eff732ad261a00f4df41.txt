    Wladimir Klitschko will defend his WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles against American challenger Tony Thompson on 7 July in Berne, Switzerland.
    Thompson, 40, was knocked out by Klitschko 
    
in their first match in 2008.
    However, the 36-year-old Ukrainian maintains Thompson gave him "one of the toughest challenges in my career".
    The bout will be Klitschko's 21st world championship fight and his first appearance since 
    
a knockout win over Jean-Marc Mormeck of France in March. 
    Klitschko, 
    
who beat Britain's David Haye in 2011,  

     has 57 wins (50 KOs) and three defeats since turning pro in 1996.
    Southpaw Thompson, who has won all five bouts since the defeat by Klitschko, has a career record of 36-2 (24 KOs).
