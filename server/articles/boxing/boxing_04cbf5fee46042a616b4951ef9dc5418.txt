Indeed, with American audiences watching his progress on Saturday, Brook promised to deliver a knock-out of his durable 36-year-old Ukrainian opponent."I can tell that he (Senchenko) wants it, I know that I'm in for a tough fight. I know that he's trained and he's ready for it," Brook told Sky Sports. "I'm just happy with how I've prepared, I'm ready for war."Obviously after the injury, the setback it made me look at myself. It's reignited myself, it's given me the drive."He's tall, he uses his range well. He's been there, he's got the t-shirt, he's been a champion and boxed at that level, so I expect him to box out of his skin. He's a great champion so he's going to give it his all."I've definitely got to go for a knockout. I've trained hard for it... I've got myself in great condition and you could see today on the scales I'm ready for whatever needs to be done."He's taller than me so he's going to get chopped down like a tree baby, I'm coming for him!"
