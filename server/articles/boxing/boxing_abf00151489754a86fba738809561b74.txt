John Simpson: Defeated Choi in his last fight (Pic Lawrence Lustig)Tommy Coyle will now face former British champion John Simpson in Hull on November 2, live on Sky Sports, after Gavin Rees was forced to pull out of the fight through injury.Rees's elbow injury has opened the door for Simpson to gatecrash the highly competitive domestic lightweight division, after previously holding the Lonsdale belt at super-featherweight.Coyle is back in action after his fantastic performance against Derry Mathews for the Commonwealth title at Craven Park Stadium in July, while Simpson enters the contest off the back of a cracking win over Choi Tseveenpurev in May, a bout shortlisted for the Fight of the Year award by the British Boxing Board of Control."We went from one war with Gavin to another with John and Tommy, and the fight fans know what to expect from these two," said promoter Eddie Hearn. "I was disappointed for Gavin - he won't feature again until 2014 now."Coyle's clash with Simpson is part of a cracking line-up of action in Hull as Luke Campbell MBE fights for the third time as a pro and the second time in his hometown, with Lee Connolly taking on the Olympic Gold medal hero.Unbeaten Sheffield heavyweight Richard Towers faces Australian Lucas Browne in an eliminator for the Commonwealth title, while Driffield lightweight Curtis Woodhouse returns after his Commonwealth title challenge.Three more Hull favourites are in action - featherweight Samir Mouneimne, light-welterweight Zak Collins and lightweight Joel Haigh.
