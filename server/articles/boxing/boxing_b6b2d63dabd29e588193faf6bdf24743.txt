Savannah Marshall: Added the World Combat Games gold to her European Union medal of the same colour from earlier this yearSavannah Marshall added the World Combat Games gold to an increasing medal haul after a comprehensive win after Qian Li of China in the middleweight final on Thursday.The Hartlepool boxer was in control from start to finish and won a unanimous decision in the four round contest, 40-36 on all three judges cards.With Marshall using her snapping left-hand jab expertly, her Chinese opponent rarely got a look in and was caught time and again by the reigning World Champion's sharp combinations.Marshall was far from happy after her quarter-final win as she claimed to have been bitten by her Brazilian counterpart but, in the final, Li seldom got close enough to even attempt such a thing.As the fight went on it became clear that short of a knock-out, Marshall was heading for the gold medal and as the bell sounded at the end of the fourth round, the verdict was a mere formality.Marshall was duly announced as the new champion and her performances throughout the week suggest it will take some special to stop her in the coming months.
