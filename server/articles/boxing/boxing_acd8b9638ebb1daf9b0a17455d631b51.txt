Robert Stieglitz: Was rarely troubled in LeipzigRobert Stieglitz retained his WBO super-middleweight title with a dominant points win over Isaac Ekpo in Leipzig.Stieglitz's superior boxing skills gave him the edge against the Nigerian challenger, who failed to show enough attacking ambition, and he took a unanimous verdict with two scores of 118-110 and one tally of 119-109.The German regained his belt with a stoppage of Arthur Abraham earlier this year and his reign rarely looked in danger as Ekpo was forced on the back foot from the early stages.Stieglitz dictated the fight with a steady stream of punches, while Ekpo was forced into a defensive shell, offering the occasional wild punch in response.Ekpo showed some urgency in the final few rounds and landed some powerful shots, but Stieglitz withstood the late assault and can look ahead to some big-name fights.On the undercard, heavyweight Manuel Charr claimed a fifth round technical knockout win over Denis Bakhtov after the Russian was unable to continue due to an injured hand.
