Andrew Selby: Impressive victory over CubanWelsh pair Andrew Selby and Fred Evans moved within one more victory of a guaranteed medal at the World Championships in Almaty.The duo scored unanimous victories in their second round fights on Tuesday taking them within touching distance of at least a bronze.Flyweight top seed Selby won a terrific contest against Cuba's Gerardo Tejeira, making the most of his lightning-fast reflexes to emerge as a clear winner on the judges' cards.Olympic silver medallist Evans - also top seed in the welterweight category, eased his way through to the last eight with a comfortable victory over Kenya's Rayton Okwiri.Ireland will have five fighters in the quarter-finals after wins for flyweight Paddy Barnes and light-heavyweight Joe Ward on Tuesday.Barnes, a double Olympic medallist at light-fly, scored a first-round stoppage win over Kenya's Simon Nzioki, who had advanced due to a cut sustained by England's Charlie Edwards in the previous round.And European champion Ward won a unanimous decision over Hungary's Norbert Harcsa to join team-mates Tommy McCarthy, Jason Quigley and Michael Conlan in the last eight.Belfast lightweight Sean McComb failed to join them after dropping a split decision to Azerbaijan's Elvin Isayev, while Scotland light-heavyweight Scott Forrest lost a unanimous verdict to Peter Mullenberg of Holland.
