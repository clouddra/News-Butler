Tommy Coyle: Stopped veteran Scot John Simpson in the seventhTommy Coyle got his career back on track with a seventh round stoppage of Scotland's John Simpson in Hull on Saturday night.Coyle endured a painful defeat at the hands of Derry Matthews last time out, being brutally knocked out in the tenth round having bossed the fight up to that point.But he got back to winning ways in impressive fashion against the durable Simpson, although the veteran from Greenock had taken the bout at just four weeks' notice.Coyle made a bright start as he won the opener in convincing fashion, catching his man with several crisp shots before darting back out of range for the most part.Simpson, despite sustaining a cut above his right eye following a clash of heads, came back into things in the second, but was then put on the canvas just before the bell by a sharp combination from Coyle which prompted a standing count.He regrouped well and began to draw his opponent into a more scrappy contest in the trenches, enjoying easily his most productive round in the fourth.But Coyle then managed to revert back to his game-plan in the fifth and used his movement to good effect as he produced by far the cleaner work behind his jab.Having taken the sixth, the end then came in the seventh as Coyle put his man down again following a short right to the head.Simpson was up quickly and looked to have slipped rather on his way down, but there was no doubting a second knock-down when Coyle caught him with a scything right.The veteran Scot got up and looked to be on steady legs as he took the count in a neutral corner, but the referee had, somewhat surprisingly, seen enough and opted to wave the contest off - much to Simpson's displeasure."I think you can see the improvement in my performance," a delighted Coyle told Sky Sports. "That last performance with Derry was a good performance but I was making mistakes and those mistakes cost me the fight."John Simpson is a warrior, he'd have gone 15 rounds, but I think the referee did a good job. I'm back now with a good win and we can look to the future."
