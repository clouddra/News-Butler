Jamie Moore is to train Matthew Macklin after his defeat to Gennady Golovkin.Matthew Macklin has confirmed that former rival Jamie Moore has agreed to train him and will be in his corner when he returns to the ring in December.The pair were involved in an epic British title fight seven years ago when Moore stopped his rival in the tenth round of a brutal contest.Having retired in 2010, Moore has since gone on to a career in training and will now join forces with Macklin as the 31-year-old bids to finally end his long wait for a world title.Macklin was soundly beaten in three rounds by the outstanding Gennady Golovkin in his last outing at the end of June, but still feels he has plenty to offer the middleweight division.Having already had unsuccessful world title shots against Felix Sturm (which resulted in a controversial split decision loss) and Sergio Martinez, as well Golovkin, the Birmingham-born fighter feels Moore could be the man to help him make the final step.His comeback fight will be against American Willie Nelson in Atlantic City on December 7 and Macklin is looking forward to working with his former foe."I just thought, at this stage of my career, I don't want anyone that's going to change me," he told Sky Sports' Ringside."I want someone that, obviously, knows their boxing and can read a fight and can make an adjustment in the corner if they need to, but also someone that knows me as a fighter, knows my strengths and weaknesses."Jamie obviously studied me when we had our fight and we've been friends and followed each other's careers since. I thought he was the ideal person."For his part, Moore added: "When he rang me and put the feelers out it was a compliment to me that he'd asked me. I was more than willing to try and help him because we were involved in one of the best fights that's ever happened in a British ring and that sort of gives you a bond with each other that's hard to explain."So to then be asked to try and help him progress and hopefully try and win a world title is a great honour and I'm looking forward to doing it."Luke Campbell takes on Lee Connelly this weekend, follow all the action from Hull online, on tablet and mobile with our interactive text commentary from 7pm on Saturday.
