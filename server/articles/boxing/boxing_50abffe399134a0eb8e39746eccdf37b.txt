George Groves says he has 'everything it takes' to beat Carl FrochGeorge Groves has vowed to become the first man to stop Carl Froch in their world title clash on November 23.Groves will attempt to rip the WBA and IBF titles from Froch's grasp in their eagerly awaited showdown at the Phones 4u Arena in Manchester, live on Sky Sports Box Office.Froch has far more top level experience than Groves, who heads into the fight as an underdog, but the challenger is confident he will upset the odds in dramatic fashion.Groves told Sky Sports: "I'll know I'll be the first person to stop Carl Froch. He's never been stopped before. I wouldn't want to predict a round, but I'm going to hit him far too frequently, far too hard for him to take that sort of punishment for 12 rounds."He gets himself in good shape. All that means is he's in better shape to take a better beating and that's what it will be on November 23."

Froch, a three-time world champion, has questioned the standard of Groves' previous opponents and believes he is not ready to face him.But Groves, who is 11 years younger than Froch, feels the champion is on the decline and is confident he will rise to the challenge."You look at good fighters on the rise up to becoming world champion. They usually make the step up around my mark," said Groves."I'm 25 years old, this will be my 20th fight. There are lots of great champions throughout history, who have moved much quicker than I have and have gone on to do great things."Carl is a little long in the tooth if you ask me. He's had a lot of hard fights. Will he be able to keep the pace with someone like myself, who is younger, who is definitely hungrier, who wants to win."His analogy that it's Premier League against Championship, he might be right, but he might have got it the wrong way round."Groves left long-term trainer Adam Booth in the build-up to this fight and Paddy Fitzpatrick will be in his corner next month.He insists the split has not disrupted his preparations and is fully focused on Froch."It was kind of something that I was half expecting at some point," he said. "It's happened before and at this point it couldn't be patched up. You move on, I've got a big task in hand."As a boxer, sometimes you have to walk through the gym door and as soon as the door shuts all your personal problems are forgotten and you get on with your sessions in hand."The fact that it isn't bothering me inside the gym or outside the gym is fine. I'm not grieving. I'm in a good place and working with a good team. I've got a big fight to look forward to."Carl Froch defends his WBA and IBF super-middleweight titles against George Groves, live on Sky Sports Box Office on November 23.
