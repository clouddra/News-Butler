Luke Campbell was delighted to get 5 rounds in the bank before stopping Lee Connelly.Olympic gold medallist Luke Campbell made it three wins from three in his professional career with another slick display against Lee Connelly.Campbell went into the contest in his home city of Hull having not gone beyond the first round in his two previous outings in the paid ranks.The brave Connelly ensured his opponent broke new ground, but in the end Campbell's undoubted class told and he stopped his rival in the fifth round of a scheduled six.Campbell's speed and accuracy was on display right from off although he started in rather watchful fashion in the first, happy to size up his man.He soon began to go through the gears and wasted very few punches as he increasingly tagged Connelly at will, especially with his lightening jab.By the fourth there was blood streaming from the marked face of Connelly, but the Sheffield fighter refused to buckle and instead called his opponent on, insisting he was not hurt.But the volume of punches raining down on Connelly was steadily increasing and, despite his best efforts, he simply could not get close to landing anything in response with Campbell proving far too elusive.When it came the end was hugely impressive from Campbell. A body-shot sent his rival staggering back on to the ropes and he followed up with a flurry of hurtful blows to the head which left the referee with little option but to step in.The 26-year-old admitted the fight had been an ideal experience at this stage of his fledgling career, but was quick to pay tribute to his opponent."That's exactly what I needed," Campbell told Sky Sports. "All credit to Lee, what a tough guy he is, he's a little warrior and I just couldn't break him. He'd have gone to the end, I'm sure he would."It was a great fight as I needed some rounds. But it's only my third fight and I'm learning all the time."I think the referee definitely made the right decision because he was taking a fair few shots."
