James DeGale: Knows he must impress against DavisJames DeGale believes a big performance against Dyah Davis on November 16 could put him in line for some big fights in 2014.DeGale has become something of a forgotten man following his narrow loss to arch-rival George Groves back in 2011, but 'Chunky' remains highly ranked by the sanctioning bodies.And if he makes it seven wins on the spin since that solitary career defeat, big things could be just around the corner."It's time now for me to make a statement because it's not about treading water, trust me, I do want the big fights and I want the big names," said the 2008 Olympic champion."I know they're out there and big nights ahead, but now my only focus is on Davis, November 16th and delivering a big performance for the fans."I'm not overlooking him, if anything I'm more focused on him because I know where a good performance here can lead me."
