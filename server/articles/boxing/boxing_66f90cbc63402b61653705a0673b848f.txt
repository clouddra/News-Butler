It really gets me up when I come to Meadowhall, seeing all the fans come out."Training's gone really well and I'm ready. I know it's fight week, I can't wait, and I'm counting the days down now."I've got a lot of respect for Senchenko, he's a proven champion and ex-world champion."He's come over here and he's got a point to prove like he had last time with Ricky Hatton. I now want to get revenge for the fans and also for myself."I want to go out there and show why I'm talked about at the elite level."Brook missed out on a chance to fight for a world title against Devon Alexander last year due to injury.And it has now been announced that the winner of his fight with Senchenko will be in line to face the winner of Alexander's next fight against Shawn Porter.Brook said: "I'll have that in my sights also but first I've got the 26th on my mind and Senchenko."A year has come round since the injury, my mandatory has come back round and, whoever wins out of Devon and Porter, I'm next in line."I will have an eye on that but I've got a tough task on my hands first."
