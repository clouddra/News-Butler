    Dereck Chisora has appealed against the withdrawal of his licence by the British Boxing Board of Control.
    He was deemed not "a fit and proper person to hold a licence" for his actions before and after his defeat by Vitali Klitschko in Munich.
    Chisora slapped Vitali at the weigh-in, spat water at his opponent's brother Wladimir before the bout and brawled with 
    
David Haye after the fight.
    "All I want to see is a fair hearing," said promoter Frank Warren.
    Explaining why he was unhappy with the way the hearing was conducted, Warren pointed out that there was no chance to review any evidence before the hearing, while no BBBofC steward had represented Chisora's interests.
    "The appeal has gone in already. The grounds for the appeal are that we're not satisfied with the way the hearing went," he said.
    "Dereck Chisora will present his side of events and then we'll see what happens."
    Zimbabwe-born Chisora, 28, who 
    
lost the WBC heavyweight title bout 

     on points, had his boxing licence withdraw earlier this month, though he could look abroad for a licence for any future fights.
    Chisora had already been 
    
suspended indefinitely by the World Boxing Council, 

     which suggested the boxer should have anger management treatment.

    "It's a natural fight, it doesn't matter what anyone says," said Warren. "It's a bigger fight than either of them fighting Wladimir or Vitali Klitschko.
    "There's lot for them to fight about - in a proper environment. I do see the fight happening. It's the proper forum for them to settle their differences."
