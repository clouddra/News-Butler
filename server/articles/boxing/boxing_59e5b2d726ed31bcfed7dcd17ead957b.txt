Jason Quigley: Has secured a silver medal but will be looking to add the World Championships title to his European gold from earlier this yearBoxer Jason Quigley became the first Irishman to reach the AIBA World Championships final with a stunning win on Friday.The 22-year-old from County Donegal scored a unanimous points decision after outclassing Russia's Artem Chebotarev in Kazakhstan.Quigley is now assured of a silver medal but will have his sights set firmly on the middleweight gold after such an impressive display over his Russian opponent.It was a cagey opening round with both fighters looking to scout each other out and few punches of note being thrown. Quigley was given the round by two of the three judges, however, and proceeded to step it up from there.With Chebotarev looking to up the tempo, the Sky Sports Scholar was able to pick him off with increasing regularity as the round went on. Quigley's overhand right, in particular, was finding its mark time and again.There was a slight scare when the referee bizarrely issued a count to Quigley after he got his feet in a twist and stumbled slightly. It mattered not though as he was awarded the round on all three scorecards.The third round followed a similar pattern and the young Irish boxer was clearly doing damage as the referee twice called a time out to check on a cut to Cheboratev's upper lip.The Russian was able to land a couple of useful blows in the latter stages but continued to be caught frequently by Quigley.Saturday's final sees Quigley take on home favourite Zhanibek Alimkhanuly after Britain's Anthony Fowler was forced to withdraw before the fight due to a swollen hand.See more on Jason Quigley and our other scholars on the Sky Sports Scholarships homepage.
