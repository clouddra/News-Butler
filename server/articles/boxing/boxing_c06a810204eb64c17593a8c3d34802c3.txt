Brook looking to make boxing statementKell Brook has vowed to put on a show in front of his home fans when he fights Ukrainian Vyasheslav Senchenko at the Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield on Saturday night.Victory for Brook is likely to hand him an IBF world title showdown, potentially with Devon Alexander, who he was due to face on three occasions before injuries to both men derailed his shot at the champion.Senchenko will be no walkover, though, and is preparing to fight in Britain for the first time since beating Ricky Hatton in his ill-fated comeback fight last November.

Speaking at Thursday's press conference ahead of the bout, Brook warned his opponent that he will be fighting 'a monster' once the first bell sounds.He told Sky Sports: "I feel excited seeing my opponent today. We're in fight week now, I've got itchy knuckles and I can't wait to get it on."He's going to know that he's in with an animal after the first round. He's going to know that I mean serious business. When he feels my presence he's going to know that he's in with a monster."This is getting broadcast out to America so I want to make a statement and I'm going to make a statement."Beating Senchenko in style shows where I am, on the top table with the elite fighters out there. I'm looking to put a number on him."He knows that beating me gets him the No 1 position so he won't leave any stone unturned. He means business, last time when he came he did what he did to Ricky but me also I had an unbelievable training camp so Saturday can't come quick enough for me."
