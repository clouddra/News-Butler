And he will be looking to make a statement in front of his own loyal fans."I want to do a demolition job on him, put on a great performance and really have fun in my hometown," said Brook."He's been over to promote the fight and that shows he's confident, he's coming here to win and to get a second shot at a world title. It's always good to get a look at your opponent ahead of a fight, get a feel of what his chin might be like."He seemed confident and his team are used to winning. He's got a good amateur background and he almost had a bit of a swagger about him when I saw him at the press conference, and like he did when he beat Ricky Hatton - but it's a whole different story going in there with me and he's going to realise that really quickly on Saturday."The public know that this is a real fight and that's why it's going to be buzzing in the arena when I walk into the ring."The fans remember what he did to Ricky, he wanted blood then and he wants the same again. But whatever obstacles he brings, I'm going to get past them and do what I do best and that's win."I need to make a statement; it's going to be an epic night. Anthony Joshua will be up here fighting, I've had great sparring with Brian Rose who's got a big fight too, so I cannot wait to get in there and do the business."He's a world class fighter and he only lost his title on a cut. They don't give world titles out for nothing; he's proved he deserves to be at the top."We didn't need this fight, I'm number one for the IBF title but Eddie put the fight in front of me and I wanted to take it."I've put the miles in on the road and taken myself out of my comfort zone, I left my partner and my little girl at home and moved in over the road from the Wincobank, so I've trained very hard and we've taken this very, very seriously."As long as we get the end result, a win and one in style, all the hard work is more than worth it."
