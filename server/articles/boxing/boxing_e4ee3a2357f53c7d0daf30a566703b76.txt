Jason Quigley: Extended his unbeaten record to 31 fights with his win over Zoltan HarcsaJason Quigley moved a step closer to becoming Ireland's first ever AIBA World Boxing Championships gold medallist with a unanimous victory over Hungarian fourth seed Zoltan Harcsa.All three judges scored the bout 30-27 in the Irishman's favour to hand him a semi-final berth in Kazakhstan and at least a bronze medal.Quigley was rarely troubled and was ahead on all three cards almost from the off. He confirmed his dominance in the second round as he sent Harcsa to the canvas with a flush right hand.The Hungarian was able to continue but Quigley's superiority was never challenged as he took the third round to make it 31 fights undefeated going back 18 months."I went in there and I didn't complicate things," he told the Irish Independent. "I had a game plan and two or three things to do and when the first thing started working I just stuck with it.
    "I didn't panic, I didn't rush in to try and take him put because it's a three round fight. If he clips me and I go down it's party over"

"I caught him a lovely right hand in the second round and he went down."I didn't panic, I didn't rush in to try and take him put because it's a three round fight. If he clips me and I go down it's party over."I'm ready for anybody, I'm ready for anything. If I had a 12-round fight today I'd still be mentally ready for the next fight."Next up for Quigley is Artem Chebotarev in Friday's middleweight semi-final. The Russian will provide a stern test for the Sky Sports Scholar having already seen off No 1 seed Esquiva Florentino in the last 16, before winning his quarter-final with a first round knock-out.
