Acosta holds a win over former two-time world champion Julio Cesar Vazquez and the 35-year-old has also shared the ring with the likes of Robert Stieglitz and Anthony Mundine."It's a huge step up in class for Callum," said Gallagher. "He has not been a pro for even a year but we're very confident he has the goods to tackle someone of Acosta's class."Ruben has mixed with world-class company; he holds a great first round KO win over Vazquez, he's been in with Anthony Mundine and he's boxed for a world title."He's got great experience and Callum hasn't faced anything like this. He's going to give him rounds and going to give him problems too, there's no-one out there who has fought someone this good in just their ninth fight inside a year of being a pro."Callum is still wet behind the ears but there's great faith in him from Eddie. We know the risks in the fight, I've looked on the independent ratings like BoxRec and he's at number 38, so he's well-respected and will have big ambitions of his own, just like Callum has."Brian Rose also features on the bill, facing Javier Maciel in a final eliminator for the WBO light middleweight title, while Olympic gold medallist Anthony Joshua battles the experienced Paul Butlin in his second professional fight.
