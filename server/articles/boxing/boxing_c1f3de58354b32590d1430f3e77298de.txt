Froch still going strongIBF and WBA champion Carl Froch is determined to punish George Groves when the former sparring partners face off in Manchester on November 23.Veteran Froch, 36, is a heavy favourite to retain his belts against 25-year-old Groves in front of the Sky Sports cameras and says he'll take 'great pleasure' in silencing the Londoner.'The Cobra' said: "I'm the one with nothing to prove. I've done it all. I'm world champion and have beaten the best of the best. I've been in with the elite fighters. My fighting speaks for itself."George Groves has talked a lot. He's talked me down and given me a load of rubbish. He needs to now back it up. I'm going to take great pleasure in beating him."It will be Froch's 11th consecutive world title bout in a 33-fight career that includes just two defeats - but the Nottingham hero insists he isn't feeling the pace despite his advancing years.He said: "I know that fight time is coming soon. I'm in great shape. I know when I jump on the scales, with the sparring, the aches and pains and the stage of my training camp that we're getting close."The minute I don't feel great and can't do what I need to do to box for potentially 12 rounds - that's when I'll retire. While I'm still enjoying it and able to do it, I'll continue to do it."I still feel physically great. At 36 years old, some people are past their best and in and out of prime condition, but I'm very much in my prime at this age."Carl Froch v George Groves is live on Sky Box Office HD on November 23 at 8pm
