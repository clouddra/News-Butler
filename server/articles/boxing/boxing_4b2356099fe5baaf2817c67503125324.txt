Olympic Gold medalist Luke Campbell says he is ready for Lee Connelly.Luke Campbell came in just under the limit ahead of his third professional fight against Lee Connelly at the Hull Arena this weekend.The 26-year-old Olympic gold medallist looked in superb condition as he tipped the scales at 134 pounds 7 ounces, just shy of the 135 pound lightweight limit.Having won his first two professional bouts with first round stoppages, Campbell will be looking to maintain a hugely-impressive start to life in the paid ranks.His opponent Connelly was almost exactly the same weight at Friday's weigh-in, coming in just an ounce lighter than his opponent.The 26-year-old from Derbyshire has won only two of his seven professional outings, but has gone the distance in each of those contests and will be looking to take Campbell into new territory on Saturday night."I can't wait," Campbell told Sky Sports. "I've been training hard and it's always great to be back in your home city with your home fans. It's about going out there and doing the business on the night."I want to show the fans a lot more and what I'm capable of. I'm expecting a tough six rounds with Connelly so it should make a great fight for the fans."I'm not taking Connelly for granted whatsoever, I'm taking him seriously as I do every one of my opponents. I'm going in there with a serious head on ready for a good fight."It's booming this (lightweight) division and I'm happy to be part of that. Hopefully I'll be involved in some great fights down the line."I know what I want in life. My feet are firmly on the ground, I've got goals I want to reach and I'm focused on what I do, I train hard."Follow all the action from Hull online, on tablet and mobile with our interactive text commentary from 7pm on Saturday.
