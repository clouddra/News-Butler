Gennady Golovkin with legendary ring announcer Michael BufferGennady Golovkin is confident he will do a job on Curtis Stevens when he defends his WBA middleweight title on Saturday night.The Kazakh is unbeaten in 27 fights and his fearsome power means he enters the contest against Stevens (25-3) in New York as a hot favourite.And with Stevens also boasting a good knockout ratio fans are expecting fireworks - while it lasts."He's a strong guy and a good puncher, but I think it's a good fight for us," he said. "I'm the champion."I'm ready for a long fight, a decision. But I'm looking for a knockout. If he wants to make it ugly, I'm ready."Stevens has fallen short before against fringe contenders Andre Dirrell and Jesse Brinkley, but will be looking to pull off a shock win as a voluntary contender in his first world title fight."I make the weight easily and I'm much stronger and faster," said the American, who used to campaign at super-middleweight."I'm mentally focused. I've got to zone out and stick to the gameplan. I'm not going to say I'm going to knock him out but I'm going to become champion."
