    "We did a few sessions together just to see how it would work, and he then agreed to train me. I was made up about that."

With Price's world title ambitions in tatters, the Liverpudlian giant has tasked Booth with the opportunity to help him rebuild."To begin with I contacted a handful of world-class trainers and asked Adam if I could have a chat and perhaps get some advic," said Price, who remains British and Commonwealth champion."When I first turned pro I was signed by Hayemaker and only left because of the television situation at the time. Adam pointed me in the right direction after that - and advised me to go with Frank Maloney - and I've always valued his opinion."So, after a brief chat, I brought up the idea of him possibly training me and we decided to have a meeting. I assumed he wanted to see what kind of frame of mind I was in."We did a few sessions together just to see how it would work, and he then agreed to train me. I was made up about that because I know Adam is very selective when it comes to choosing fighters to work with."I've got a good feeling about this move, and truly believe Adam is the man to bring out my true potential."Price admits Booth - who masterminded David Haye's rise to heavyweight champion - has a meticulous approach outside the ring that means the pair should be a perfect fit."The mental side of the game is a big issue for me, and that's something Adam spends a lot of time thinking about and working on," he added. "Even just sitting down and having a chat with him, I can tell we share a lot of the same ideas about the sport and about life."We've both got the same outlook, and this should make it very easy to gel. He has helped me get a few things off my chest recently, which has made me feel like the weight of the world has been lifted from my shoulders. It's a good feeling."Ultimately, I know I've made the right choice and I know this move will take me to that next level."
