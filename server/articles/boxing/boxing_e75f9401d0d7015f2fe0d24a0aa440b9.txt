Jason Quigley (R): And Zhanibek Alimkhanuly (L) met in the World Championships middleweight final and now share top spot in the world rankingsIrish middleweight Jason Quigley is joint top of the latest world rankings following his historic silver medal at the AIBA World Championships on Saturday.The 22-year-old from Ballbofey in County Donegal shares top spot with gold medallist Zhanibek Alimkhanuly of Kazakhstan after the pair went into the tournament in joint seventh position.A walkover in the semi-final gave Alimkhanuly an extra two days rest over Quigley ahead of the final in Almaty but whilst that may have given him a slight advantage in the fight, it is also the reason top spot is shared.Quigley was treated to a hero's welcome upon his arrival back in Ireland after becoming the first of his countrymen ever to achieve better than a bronze medal at the World Championships.That the Sky Sports Scholar was disappointed with silver in Kazakhstan shows the standards and ambition that he has and he will undoubtedly be looking to bounce back from his defeat, his first in 33 bouts.One goal for Quigley now will be making that place at the top of the world rankings his own.
