Zab Judah: Looking to claim bragging rights in a potential thriller in New YorkZab Judah will clash with Paulie Malignaggi in New York on December 7 in a show being billed as 'King of Brooklyn'.The former world champions, both from the same borough in the city of New York, will be hungry for bragging rights in front of their home fans."I have always admired Zab's skills and his resume speaks for itself," said Malignaggi, a native of Bensonhurst. "But this is the 'Battle of Brooklyn' and winning this fight is worth more than any world title."The pair have both held world titles at light-welterweight and welterweight, with December's clash being held at the upper limit."Paulie and I have known each other for a long time and we have a mutual respect for each other, but with this fight it is going to be like the ancient Roman days," said Judah."There has to be a leader and that position belongs to me."Judah has been in with some of the best over more than a decade but showed there was still life in the old dog with a narrow points loss to the undefeated light-welterweight king Danny Garcia last time.In the co-feature, interim WBA light-middleweight champion Erislandy Lara goes up against former champion Austin Trout, who has not fought since losing his title to Saul Alvarez in April.
