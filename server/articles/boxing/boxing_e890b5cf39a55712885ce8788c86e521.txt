Timothy Bradley is undefeated in 30 fights but he's taking on a future hall of famer in Juan Manuel MarquezTimothy Bradley and Juan Manuel Marquez, who handed back-to-back defeats to Manny Pacquiao last year, turned their attention to each other ahead of Saturday's showdown for the WBO Welterweight crown.Future hall of famer Marquez produced a memorable performance last December, knocking out Filipino Pacquiao; while Bradley was the benefactor of a split decision when he faced the eight-division world champion in February.Both fighters made the grade at Friday's weigh-in with defending champion Bradley making a lean 146 pounds, while Marquez looked slightly worn at 144.5 pounds.Marquez heads into the bout with an opportunity to become the first Mexican to hold titles in five weight divisions, and with Las Vegas becoming a mini-Mexico, the 40-year-old is full of assurance."This is confidence for me, I have trained very hard, I have confidence and I want to give another great fight for all my fans," Mexican Marquez told Sky Sports.Despite being on home soil, Bradley - who is undefeated in 30 fights - entered the theatre to a round of jeers but insists such reaction does nothing but motivate him."I'm focussed, determined and hungry for this," Bradley said. "I'm enjoying this time out on the stage, people booing, I love it. Boo me more, please, give me more fuel."Marquez is a very, very dangerous opponent, he has power in both hands and he is very clever which means I have to be intelligent starting out."Midway through the fight I like to take chances so you may see me step in there and maybe go at Marquez."You can watch Timothy Bradley v Juan Manuel Marquez on Sky Sports 1HD from midnight tonight
