    Tony Bellew's British light-heavyweight title defence against Danny McIntosh has been postponed until 27 April after McIntosh pulled out through illness.
    The pair had been due to meet at Liverpool's Echo Arena on 13 April, but a chest infection has forced McIntosh to withdraw from the initial date.
    Bellew, from Liverpool, 
    
won the British title against Ovill McKenzie 

     last July.
    But the 29-year-old 
    
failed in his attempts to become WBO world champion, 

     losing to Nathan Cleverly in October.
