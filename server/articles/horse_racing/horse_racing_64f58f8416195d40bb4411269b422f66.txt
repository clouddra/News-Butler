Estimate: Confirmation that filly remains in training next yearThe Queen's classy stayer Estimate is set to stay in training next year, despite failing to end the season on a high at Ascot on Saturday.The four-year-old filly had given her owner an unforgettable day when winning the Gold Cup at the Royal meeting and another big performance was expected in the QIPCO British Champions Long Distance Cup.However, the daughter of Monsun could only finish seventh, beaten three lengths, behind Royal Diamond on her return to action.Connections believe the soft ground was to blame for the below-par display."Nothing came to light (after Ascot), it was just the soft ground, everyone says," said The Queen's racing manager John Warren."I think The Queen is quite happy to keep her going next year, which would be great."
