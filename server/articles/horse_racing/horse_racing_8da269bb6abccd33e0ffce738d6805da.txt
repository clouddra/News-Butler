Lucy Alexander: Remarkably chipperLucy Alexander could be back in action as soon as Carlisle's meeting on Thursday after suffering a broken nose in a fall at Kelso on Saturday.Last season's champion conditional jockey was partnering Frankie's Promise for her father Nick in the first division of the maiden hurdle when she was unseated at the second obstacle, suffering a kick in the face.Alexander snr reports his daughter to be in good spirits and determined to get back in the saddle as soon as possible.He said: "She seems fine this morning. She's just gone out for a walk, she doesn't look very pretty but she's remarkably chipper. She's intending to get back as soon as possible, probably at Carlisle on Thursday."She's broken her nose but it's not displaced or anything. She's going to have two big, black eyes I would imagine. It may regress during the week, but at the moment she's looking at Carlisle I think."
