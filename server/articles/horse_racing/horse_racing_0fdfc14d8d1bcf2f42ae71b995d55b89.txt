Maxime Guyon: Rode the winnerYorkshire raiders Double Bluff and Rising Breeze trailed home well beaten as Elliptique claimed Group Three honours in the Prix de Conde at Longchamp.The Mark Johnston-trained Double Bluff was stepping up in class following a maiden victory at Goodwood last month and although he disputed the running for much of the nine-furlong journey, Joe Fanning's mount dropped away quickly in the straight.Rising Breeze, also trained in Middleham by Karl Burke, was under pressure from an early stage and never threatened to land a blow under Antoine Hamelin.Double Bluff and Rising Breeze finished second-last and last respectively, with Andre Fabre's Elliptique, ridden by Maxime Guyon, edging out Diaghan and Salai in a driving finish.
