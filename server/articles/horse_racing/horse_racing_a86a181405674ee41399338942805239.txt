Damien Oliver wins aboard FiorenteRed Cadeaux had to settle for second once again as Fiorente claimed the Emirates Melbourne Cup at Flemington.Ed Dunlop's charge filled the runner-up spot in 2011 and once again found one too good in the Gai Waterhouse-trained winner.The Luca Cumani-trained Mount Athos was third with Willie Mullins' Simenon fourth to complete a European clean sweep of the minor honours.Another British raider, Ed Walker's Ruscello, set the early gallop as the Tom Dascombe-trained Brown Panther was another to race prominently in the early stages for the European contingent.Ruscello was still in front with six furlongs to run but the challengers were lining up in behind, with Red Cadeaux, who had to contend with a high draw, poised on the outside of the field turning for home.Fiorente was tracking him though and the pair really started to battle with a furlong to run, with Damien Oliver launching Fiorente on the outside.While Red Cadeaux responded to Gerald Mosse's every urging, Fiorente just had too much in reserve and edged in front at the line.Mount Athos ran a game race up the inside to finish third and hold off Simenon while Marco Botti's Dandino was noted finishing fast in fifth.Oliver was claiming his third Melbourne Cup win following Doriemus in 1995 and Media Puzzle in 2002 while Waterhouse was saddling her first winner of the famous race.The victory was a particular highlight for Oliver, who served a lengthy suspension after admitting backing a rival horse in a race in 2010.He said: "It's amazing, a dream come true. It's really hard to believe."I'm so rapt right now that I've been part of Gai's first win - she's done so much for racing and it's a great honor for me to help her bring up the first one."Gai was one of the first people to really get behind me when I came back and I can't thank her enough for helping me get going again."We've had a bit of luck in our careers but there's nothing better than winning this one."It's every jockey's dream come true. It's a really special moment," he told At The Races.Waterhouse added: "Didn't he ride him a treat? It was just fantastic - a dream come true. All the people who came up to me and said 'good luck Gai', they're the people I'm thrilled for."Fiorente began life with Sir Michael Stoute and won the 2012 renewal of the Princess Of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket before being sold at the end of last term.Dunlop was thrilled with Red Cadeaux's performance and hailed the efforts of Mosse.He said: "The jockey has probably given as good a ride as he could without winning a Melbourne Cup."I'm so proud of the horse. He's older and he's carrying more weight and he's probably run as well, if not better, than when he was second here before."You never know, he could still come back here next year, but we will certainly be looking at Japan and Hong Kong."Cumani is another to have come agonisingly close to a first British win with both Bauer and Purple Moon finishing second in 2008 and 2007 respectively.Mount Athos was fifth in the race last year and Cumani was pleased with his effort, although he admitted his draw in stall 22 had hardly helped his chance.He said: "He was in the right place and there were no excuses. he's run a great race and finished off well."It's hard to change the draw now, but I'll certainly be back here next year if I've got the horse."Mullins was similarly satisfied with Simenon and could target the race again next year."There were no excuses, he was just beaten by a better horse on the day. He was there all the way round," said the Irish handler."I've no problem coming back and maybe he might have some company."Jockey Richard Hughes added: "He ran a blinder. They kind of quickened a length on me but if I'd gone then it would have been a long way home."I'm very, very pleased with him."Botti felt the two-mile trip might have stretched Dandino's stamina.He said: "He stayed all right but Ryan (Moore, jockey) said he did get a little tired in the last furlong."He still ran very well and we could go to Hong Kong."Owner Michael Owen reported that Brown Panther was struck into during the race.He tweeted: "8th out of 24 pretty respectable. Proud of him. Just hope he is OK as he has been struck into during the race."He later confirmed that the injury was nothing too severe as he tweeted: "Scan has come back clear. Only superficial gash that requires stitches. We live to fight another day!!!''Dunaden, winner of the race in 2011, finished down the field.Trainer Mikel Delzangles said: "With the weight he had, he was quite outpaced."Fellow French-trained runner Verema pulled up sharply in the early stages of the race after fracturing her right foreleg and had to be humanely destroyed.
