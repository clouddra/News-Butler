Paul Nolan (right): Trainer of Defy LogicThe Madigans Bars Craddockstown Chase at Punchestown is the likely next port of call for Defy Logic following his impressive debut over fences at Naas last month.Having shown smart form over hurdles last season, the JP McManus-owned six-year-old sauntered to a 19-length victory having cut out every yard of the running on his chasing bow.Paul Nolan's charge is now set to step up to Grade Two level at Punchestown on November 17, subject to ground conditions and further discussions with connections.Nolan said: "Mark (Walsh, jockey) was very pleased with him on the day and said he settled well during the race."He was a little bit guessy at one of the fences passing the stands but I was happy to see him pop a couple of fences after that."It was a nice round of jumping on the whole and a nice start to the season for him. He showed he has good respect for a fence and hopefully he'll go on from here."The Craddockstown is what we're looking at, but we'll see what Frank (Berry, McManus' racing manager) thinks and go from there."The ground would have to be soft enough for him and Punchestown can dry up quite quickly, so we'll see."
