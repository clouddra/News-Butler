Dodging Bullets: Quoted for the Arkle TrophyDodging Bullets made a winning start to his career over fences in the William Hill - In App Store Beginners' Chase at Kempton.The Paul Nicholls-trained five-year-old looked set to take high rank in the novice hurdle division last season after back-to-back victories at Cheltenham and an excellent third in the Christmas Hurdle, but his spring efforts at Cheltenham and Aintree were less inspiring.An 8/11 favourite on his first foray over larger obstacles, Dodging Bullets, who was bred by Frankie Dettori, jumped efficiently in the hands of Daryl Jacob and moved into contention from the home turn.He was matched by Turn Over Sivola until the second-last, when the latter lost all chance of victory with a serious blunder. Dodging Bullets quickly asserted and successfully negotiated the final fence to seal a four-length triumph.Nicholls said: "That was a nice start. He needed a confidence-booster after two disappointing races in the spring and we never knew why (he ran so poorly)."He had a minor operation and he has schooled (over fences), but it was a bit of a rush to get him here. He will improve from that and he'll be slightly better left-handed. Daryl said he was enjoying his jumping out there."Paddy Power make Dodging Bullets a 16/1 shot for the Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham next March while Sky Bet introduced him into the market at 25/1.John Ferguson's Sea Lord also received Festival quotes after securing his sixth successive win in the William Hill - On Your Mobile Novices' Hurdle. The ex-Mark Johnston and Godolphin runner was a Group Three winner on level, but was remarkably beaten on his first two starts over obstacles.He has not looked back since making it third time lucky at Southwell in May, however, following up at Huntingdon, Worcester, Market Rasen, Perth and now in this Listed even under Denis O'Regan.With Hallings Comet setting a strong pace before fading, Sea Lord was not foot-perfect at every flight, but his class edge was clear as he cruised into contention rounding the home bend.Life And Soul briefly threatened to make a race of it, but the even-money favourite Sea Lord eventually mastered him and finished strongly to score by nine lengths.Ferguson said: "He's a lovely horse and he's enjoying what he does. He's not been tried on this (ground) before and there were a few question marks. He handled it well and Denis gave him a lovely, patient ride. He's won, but he should have done - if it was a handicap he'd have given them a stone."In time I think he's a horse who could step up to two and a half (miles). They were going very quick early on and he was a bit rusty as he hasn't run for a while."You've got the option for going for a novice at Cheltenham. He's a novice and it makes sense to keep them in novice company for the moment, at the highest level if we're going to go down that route."We'll see what he's like when we get him home. He's been running for a long time and if he's full of enthusiasm and bounce we'll carry on. If we believe he's a nice horse for the spring next year, he needs to have a break at some time, but he's not a horse you can give a complete break to as he enjoys his work so much."Sea Lord is a 20/1 shot with Paddy Power for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival.O'Regan quickly doubled up for the day as he guided Firm Order to a clear-cut victory in the William Hill - iPhone, iPad, iPad Mini Handicap Chase.Runner-up on his last two appearances at Uttoxeter and Worcester in May of this year, Firm Order was a 12/1 shot for his return to action and was given a typically patient ride by his sympathetic jockey.O'Regan gradually eased Paul Webber's charge closer to the leaders heading down the back straight and he was a close-up third at the top of the home straight.As the runners bypassed the third and second last fences to avoid the stricken Highrate, injured on the first circuit, Firm Order began to assert and he was spring heeled at the last to seal a nine-length win over Suburban Bay.At the start of the day Duroble Man made a big step forward from a disappointing hurdling debut to get off the mark at the second attempt.An 86-rated middle-distance runner on the Flat for Roger Varian, the three-year-old changed hands for 130,000 guineas in the middle of summer to pursue a jumps career with Alan King.Having run far too keen to do himself justice at Market Rasen, Duroble Man appeared far more amenable during the William Hill - Download The App Juvenile Hurdle.As the front-running Complexity was eventually pulled up after hanging violently, Town Mouse led both 2/1 favourite Duroble Man and French bumper winner Aldopicgros into the straight.Town Mouse, who has finished ahead of Duroble Man at Market Rasen, remained in front after the final flight, but Robert Thornton's mount found more on the run-in to take the spoils by a length and three-quarters.Thornton told Racing UK: "The plan at Market Rasen was to pop out (in front). We just felt he wanted a nice introduction, a clear round jumping and everything to go right, which happened. We knew he'd improve from Market Rasen, which is what he's done."He didn't settle ever so well over the first two (hurdles), but I had no cover as everything else wanted to drop in."Down the back he was great and his jumping has probably won it for him in the end. He's very efficient and he's been very good to school from day one. He might just be progressive."Trainer Tim Vaughan and jockey Richard Johnson combined to take the William Hill - Exclusive Mobile Offers Handicap Chase with 15/8 favourite Gallox Bridge.Mick Channon's Warden Hill was the sixth winning favourite from the seven races as he struck at 11/4 in the concluding William Hill Radio - Download The App 'National Hunt' Novices' Hurdle under Dominic Elsworth.
