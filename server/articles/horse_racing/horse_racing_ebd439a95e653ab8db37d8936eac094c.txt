Kevin Prendergast: Steps Daymooma up in grade on SaturdayKevin Prendergast gives Daymooma the chance to make amends for an unlucky run last time and pick up some black type in the Listed Trigo Stakes at Leopardstown on Saturday.The Friarstown handler steps the Pivotal filly up in grade after she was beaten just half a length in a nine-furlong handicap on this track seven weeks ago."She's very well. It looks a hot contest but we're expecting a big run from her," said Prendergast."She was a bit unlucky the last day. She had a bit of trouble coming out of the gates."One came across her, otherwise we think she should have won. This is a chance to get black type for her."Andy Oliver expects Uleavemebreathless to put up her usual game performance.The Tiger Hill filly was runner-up to Mango Diva in a Group Three contest at Gowran last month before taking third place behind Wannabe Better in a Listed heat at Naas last week."She's in great form. She's a really tough, genuine filly and never runs a bad race," said the County Tyrone handler."She's very ground versatile and has run well over the trip so we are hoping for another big run."She's never missed a day, she's tough and she's sound."A lot of the top trainers in Ireland are represented in this 10-runner race, with Aidan O'Brien saddling Beach Of Falesa, Dermot Weld running Sleeping Beauty and John Oxx responsible for Tarana, who has been absent since making a winning debut at the Curragh 13 months ago.
