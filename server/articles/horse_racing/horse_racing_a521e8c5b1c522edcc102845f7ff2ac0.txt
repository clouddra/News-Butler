McCoy: Closing in on landmark victoryTony McCoy admits he may have to wait at least another day before chalking up his 4,000th winner.The Irishman has three rides booked at Exeter today - Flemenson (1.50), Keen Eye (2.30) and Well Hello There (3.50) - at the track where he recorded his first victory on English soil aboard the Gordon Edwards-trained Chickabiddy back in 1994.Two wins at Kempton on Monday took McCoy onto the 3,998 mark and he is hopeful at least one of his mounts will put him within touching distance of the landmark later today.Speaking to Sky Sports News, he said: "Flemenson is the best of my rides today. He won well at Uttoxeter last time and is a nice sort of horse."But Keen Eye will need to improve out of all recognition to have a chance of winning while Well Hello There is definitely a better horse on good ground so the rain here last night certainly won't have helped him."If I had one winner out of the three then I would be delighted and if I get two then that would be amazing."The pressure on reaching 4,000 has not really got to me. When I rode 1,000 winners I couldn't believe it, similarly with 2,000 and 3,000."But when I did ride the 3,000th I actually genuinely believed I could reach 4,000. That comes with confidence and if I stay in one piece then hopefully it will come."The sooner the better as far as I'm concerned and it would be nice if it was today, but if not hopefully in the near future."Guide to Tony McCoy's booked rides for Tuesday13.50: FlemensonIrish point winner who beat a useful sort on his hurdling bow at Uttoxeter. Penalised as a result, however, and this is traditionally quite a strong hurdle so he faces no easy task. Forecast price: 5/214.20: Keen EyeHas been well held on both starts to date and there are some very smart prospects in this field so it would be surprising to see him trouble the principals. Forecast price: 14/115.50: Well Hello ThereUseful hurdler at his best who has adapted well to chasing. Took a tumble on his return from a summer break, however, which may have affected his confidence and this is a competitive race. Forecast price: 7/2
