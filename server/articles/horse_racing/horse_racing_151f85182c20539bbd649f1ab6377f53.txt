Sir Mark Prescott: Trains AthenianAthenian gave a gutsy display to defy top weight in the Best Odds At bookmakers.co.uk Handicap at Wolverhampton.The Sir Mark Prescott-trained filly came with a pulsating run in the straight under Luke Morris to get the better of Burren View Lady in the final half-furlong.The two 3-1 joint-favourites battled out a good finish, with Athenian getting the upper hand by a neck. Space Artist was three lengths back in third."She'd just not struck form really this year after the spring. We waited when the ground firmed up for her in the spring and we thought we'd have quite a good autumn," said Prescott."Although she came back with a good run at Hamilton the next run at Goodwood was disappointing so it was nice to see her back to form today."I thought horse and jockey did well to get through. We were delighted and if she's all right she'll go to France on the 21st, to Fontainebleau for a Listed race."She's in the December sales and the owners may, or may not, decide to keep her as the case may be."
