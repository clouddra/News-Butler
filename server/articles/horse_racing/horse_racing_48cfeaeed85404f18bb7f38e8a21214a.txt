ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Artic North rallied to win the $51,000 Lassen Purse by a half-length at Santa Anita on Thursday.Ridden by Joe Talamo, Artic North ran 1 1/8 miles on the turf in 1:48.52 and paid $13.20, $6.40 and $4.60. The 4-year-old gelding went three-wide at the top of the stretch before making his rally.''He's a nice horse that wants to run all day, so we have high hopes for him,'' trainer Peter Miller said. ''I like this distance or even further, up to a mile and a quarter, or even a mile and a half.''Garrett Gomez, who was originally named to ride Artic North, was off all of his mounts for the second day in a row, and his agent Tony Matos said Gomez won't ride for a while.Gomez was fined and suspended for missing mounts in August at Del Mar while being treated for a relapse of alcohol problems. He returned later that month, saying he was ready to restart his career.Holladay Road returned $3.60 and $2.80, while Vibrato Jazz was another neck back in third and paid $3.80 to show.The victory, worth $30,600, increased Artic North's career earnings to $80,220, with two wins in four starts.
