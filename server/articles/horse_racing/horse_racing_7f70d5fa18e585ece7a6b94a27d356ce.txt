Brian Meehan: Trains Great HallThe All-Weather Championships continue with a twilight fixture at Kempton Park on Wednesday, November 6, which is headlined by the Â£37,000 Listed Winners Are Welcome At Betdaq Floodlit Stakes.A field of seven is set to go to post for the mile and a half contest, including the Brian Meehan-trained Great Hall, who will wear blinkers for the first time.The three-year-old was last seen finishing a creditable ninth in the Group One Ladbrokes St Leger at Doncaster on September 15, having previously annexed a valuable handicap at Haydock Park in July and a 12-furlong maiden at Newmarket in June.Kieren Fallon rides the Halling colt again.Meehan reported: "Great Hall is in good form and ran a nice race in the St Leger when the ground was too soft for him. We have put the blinkers on just to help him because Kempton will be the sharpest track he has run at. The surface will be fine for him and I wouldn't have any concerns about the drop back in trip."Great Hall's rivals include Urban Dance, a three-year-old Street Cry half-brother to Masterstroke, who will be aiming to give Godolphin a fifth consecutive win in the Floodlit Stakes after victories for Spring Of Fame (2012), Prince Bishop (2011), Mastery (2010) and Once More Dubai (2009). Urban Dance's trainer Charlie Appleby was successful at the Breeders' Cup in America on Friday with Outstrip.John Gosden, who went close to Breeders' Cup success with The Fugue, will be represented by 2012 Royal Ascot hero Gatewood, partnered by William Buick.Glorious Goodwood scorer Pether's Moon also brings good form to the table for champion trainer Richard Hannon. Smart mare Jehannedarc, Opera Box and Aussie Reigns complete the septet.Horsted Keynes is the headline act in the following Betdaq 1st UK Race Commission Free Handicap as he goes in search of a four-timer. The Roger Varian-trained three-year-old landed a similar contest at Lingfield last Thursday, October 31, and will shoulder a six pound penalty.
