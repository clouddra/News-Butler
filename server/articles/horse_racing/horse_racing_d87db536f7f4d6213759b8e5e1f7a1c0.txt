God's Own: Ran on to record a wide-margin winGod's Own (11/4) ran out a commanding winner of the Pertemps Network Handicap Hurdle as Grands Crus disappointed at Kempton Park.Tom George's five-year-old kept something of an errant course on the run in but Paddy Brennan refused to panic and he could afford to coast home some six lengths clear of his rivals.Pateese made the running in the 2m5f contest at a steady pace but Grands Crus, who had raced keenly in the early stages, pulled himself to the front as they went to the fifth flight and all appeared promising with David Pipe's grey.The winner began to make his move with four to jump and having jumped slightly across the leader as they negotiated the second last; he continued to edge right and momentarily took the pair onto the chase track.Grands Crus weakened tamely following the incident and the winner put the race to bed with Brennan allowing himself the luxury of easing down before the finish.Like Minded plugged on from a long way back to get up for second place.George said: "Paddy said he was in front probably a bit too long, he's still a baby. He won two novice hurdles last season, but he's got a bit of growing up to do."He gives us the impression he's going to be a good horse. He's going to be a better chaser than he is hurdler, so we've just got to look after him and carry on over hurdles until we think it's time to go chasing."He's got a big future, but he wouldn't want the ground any softer than it was today."An understandably disappointed Pipe said: "He was running well for while and just stopped quite quickly. We will see how he is afterwards. He looked good for a long way, hopefully it was just fitness. Only time will tell. I don't think you can make plans after that. We will get him back and see.
