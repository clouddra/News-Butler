Brown Panther: Looked in good conditionThe 11 European raiders that arrived in Australia on Saturday have reportedly settled in well in the Newminster Stakes at the quarantine centre at Werribee.The majority were given a light outing in the parade ring although the Mikel Delzangles-trained pair of Dunaden and Havana Gold stepped out onto the course very briefly on Sunday as an outing from their stable boxes.Red Cadeaux, who was only beaten by a nose in the 2011 Emirates Melbourne Cup,  has reportedly woken up in fine shape with no reports of any concern coming out from any of the traveling handlers.Tom Dascombe's Brown Panther looked very well as he stepped off the float on Saturday and is in a similarly good condition.The Peter Chapple-Hyam-trained Caravan Rolls On is on an Emirates Melbourne Cup course and is expected to be one of the first to step out onto the Werribee training circuit."He didn't eat a lot but he did have a good drink of water, just a bit tired after the long flight", work rider Graham Clark told www.racingvictoria.net.au."He traveled well otherwise and all being well he will step out on the track tomorrow," he added.
