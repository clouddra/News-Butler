    Premio Loco improved his great record on all-weather surfaces by winning the Winter Derby at Lingfield Park.
    The 5-1 shot, with George Baker on board, held off 4-1 joint favourite Cai Shen to take victory for a sixth time in 10 starts on an artificial track.
    "He's been fantastic for all of us and long may it continue," said Baker. "He's lightly raced, so hopefully he can stay at this level for a while."
    Circumvent (16-1) also challenged, but finished a head back in third.
    Premio Loco's owner Bernard Westley said: "I am so chuffed because he should have won it three years ago but was taken five wide on the bend and didn't manage it.
    "George gave him a peach of a ride. It's absolutely brilliant."
    Trainer Chris Wall added: "It depends on the ground, but we could think of the Earl of Sefton at Newmarket over nine furlongs or failing that the Sandown Mile at the end of April.
    "He doesn't like slow ground as he has got older, so they are the next two races to bear in mind."
