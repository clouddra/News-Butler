Bury Parade: Won narrowly at KemptonBury Parade (5/2) held off the late challenge of Hadrian's Approach to win the Weatherbys Hamilton Graduation Chase in a stirring finish at Kempton.The Paul Nicholls-trained winner was sent straight to the front by a confident Sam Twiston-Davies and jumped boldly at the head of affairs, whereas 11/10 market leader Hadrian's Approach made too many small mistakes throughout the extended two and a half mile trip.The Nicky Henderson-trained favourite was sat in second for much of the race but was passed by Theatre Guide heading into the final turn before staging a late rally.Bury Parade leapt five lengths clear two-out and although his lead was reduced dramatically as Hadrian's Approach flashed home in the closing stages, he was awarded the verdict by a nose after the photo was required to split them.Nicholls said: "He had been a bit keen and we weren't quite sure whether he'd get two and a half (miles). I said (to Sam Twiston-Davies, jockey) relax him in front and try and save a bit for the straight."He missed the third-last, which put him on the back foot, but he galloped well to the line and just held on. It was an ideal first start of the season."He's eligible for another graduation chase, so it could be quite interesting if we find another for him and then there is a new Listed race here in January, which might be an ideal race."Sky Bet cut Bury Parade to 16/1 from 25s for the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham.
