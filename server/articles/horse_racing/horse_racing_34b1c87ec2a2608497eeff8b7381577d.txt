Thomas Hobson: One of three possible runners for John GosdenJohn Gosden has made three entries as he bids to win the Betfred November Handicap for a sixth time at Doncaster when the curtain falls on the turf season on Saturday.The Newmarket trainer, successful with Hieroglyphic (1991), Turgenev (1992), Sabadilla (1997), Charm School (2009) and Zuider Zee (2011), is considering Aiken, Lahaag and Thomas Hobson for the mile and a half feature this time.Aiken is the classiest of the trio but has failed to sparkle so far this term, whileLahaag was a good winner at York last month and Thomas Hobson struck over this course and distance at the last meeting.Brian Ellison is double-handed in a 36-strong entry with Autun and Twelve Strings.The North Yorkshire trainer is keen to run both, although Autun will first have to pass a stalls test at Southwell on Tuesday.Autun only joined the Ellison string last week after being bought for Â£37,000 at the Horses In Training Sales at Tattersalls out of Lady Cecil's stable."We had him in the stalls today and he was fine," said Ellison."He's a lovely horse with real quality. I haven't spoken to the owner yet, but I don't seen why he shouldn't run."Twelve Strings is not guaranteed a place in the line-up but advertised his claims with an emphatic victory at Nottingham last week."He won well last week and I'm hoping the ground stays on the easy side. He goes there in good form. He'll get in the race, I think," said Ellison.Other entries include the Charlie Hills-trained duo of Forgotten Hero and Zipp, the Luca Cumani-trained Ajman Bridge, Roger Charlton's Border Legend and the Richard Fahey pair of Hi There and Kiama Bay.
