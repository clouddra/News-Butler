The official late withdrawal of Bert Trick at Wolverhampton on Thursday evening is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the British Horseracing Authority.The four-year-old was taken out of the 32RedBet.com Handicap by trainer Frank Sheridan at the request of the stewards as it was found that the horse was not qualified to run in Britain.In a statement, BHA media manager Robin Mounsey said: "Following up on information received yesterday from our intelligence gathering network, BHA initiated an investigation into the horse Bert Trick and its eligibility to race in Britain."In light of the on-going investigation, the stewards at Wolverhampton asked Bert Trick's trainer Frank Sheridan to withdraw the horse."We are aware of the effect on punters of the late withdrawal of a horse from any race. Our priority was to protect the interests of the betting public and other participants in the race by preventing an ineligible horse from running."The investigation is on-going and in line with BHA policy, no further comment will be made."Bert Trick was to have made his racecourse debut for Sheridan who trains at the Dunstall Park track. He had been well-beaten in his only three starts for Liam McAteer in Ireland in the space of three weeks in August 2011.
