Bath: Forced to abandonSunday's meeting at Bath has been abandoned after four races because of "localised flooding", said a course official.Drainage issues in an area of the weighing room led to the Flat fixture being called off after four races.A tweet posted by Bath racecourse read: "Abandoned meeting due to localised flooding in the weighing room area."Jockey Shane Kelly was in action at Bath and said there was "no other alternative" but to abandon.He said: "The drains were blocked at the bottom of the weighing room where the valets work. It wasn't very pleasant and everyone decided you couldn't possibly work in those conditions."Unfortunately for Bath's stewards, there was no other alternative but to call the meeting off. It wasn't us jockeys who said we weren't riding - it was everyone."More importantly than anything else, the valets couldn't work in those conditions. Enough was enough and common sense prevailed."Fellow jockey Jim Crowley said: "It's very disappointing that it had to come to this. The drains were overflowing with sewage and I felt so sorry for the valets who were paddling around in it all."If Health and Safety had been there, the place would have been shut down immediately."I felt very sorry for all the owners, trainers and staff who have gone down there with horses on a Sunday and for this to happen. It was basically the racecourse's fault. It wouldn't have been acceptable in any work place."A statement issued by the Bath stewards read: "The stewards held an inquiry following a complaint by the jockeys and valets as to the state of their changing room."They interviewed Richard Hughes, George Baker and Jimmy Fortune, representing all the jockeys, and two jockeys' valets, the general manager and clerk of the course."Having heard all their evidence and viewed the changing room the stewards abandoned the meeting as the riders and valets were unwilling to continue in the flooded conditions."The stewards ordered a report to be forwarded to the British Horseracing Authority."Kate Hills, director of PR and communications for Arena Racing Company which are responsible for Bath, said in a statement: "Unfortunately, Bath has had to abandon due to torrential rain causing localised flooding."Despite efforts made by the racecourse, as the downpours occurred, drains were unable to cope with the continuous heavy rain, which affected the weighing room area."Jockeys were offered alternative facilities but after discussion with the stewards it was decided that racing had to be abandoned. We will be looking into this and we are doing everything we can to ensure this situation does not reoccur next season."
