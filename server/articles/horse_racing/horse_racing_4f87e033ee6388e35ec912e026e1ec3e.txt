Cirrus Des Aigles: Hong Kong optionTrainer Corine Barande-Barbe is in no rush to decide whether Cirrus Des Aigles will head to the Far East later this year following another fantastic run in defeat in Saturday's QIPCO Champion Stakes.Winner of the race in 2011 and second behind the mighty Frankel 12 months later, the seven-year-old was sent off favourite to regain his Ascot crown having looked right back to his best in the Prix Dollar at Longchamp.While he came up narrowly short, going down by a neck to the talented but fragile Farhh, Cirrus Des Aigles emerged with his reputation intact and connections are now considering a tilt at the Hong Kong Cup on December 8.Barande-Barbe said: "He has one or two cuts on his leg, which probably happened at the moment he got a bit bumped, but they don't seem too heavy and he is on his way home now."It was another great performance from him. Maybe if he hadn't been bumped he could have started his run a bit earlier, but who knows what would have happened? That's racing."He will be entered for the Hong Kong Cup tomorrow and we will let him come back from Ascot and see how he is. We will take our time with him and when we make a decision, we'll let everyone know."As long as he's happy he will stay in training next year."
