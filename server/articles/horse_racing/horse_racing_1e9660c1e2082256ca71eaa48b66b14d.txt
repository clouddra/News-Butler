    A double at Lingfield helped Joe Fanning win the all-weather jockeys' championship, defeating Luke Morris 89-86 on the final day of the campaign. 
    Fanning was just one ahead at the start of the day but sealed the honours with a double at the Surrey track.
    He struck on Roger Teal's Ostentation before a comfortable victory on Danube River for trainer Mark Johnston.
    However, in the process Fanning picked up a two-day ban (13 and 14 April) for careless riding.
