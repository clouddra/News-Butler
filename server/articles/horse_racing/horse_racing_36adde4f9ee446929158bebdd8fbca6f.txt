Hidden Cyclone could have a racecourse gallop as part of his build-up for the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham next month.Trainer John Hanlon reports the eight-year-old to be fighting fit after his victory over jumping stalwart Forpadydeplasterer at Listowel last month."We're delighted with him and we're hoping to get a racecourse gallop into him somewhere and get him schooling again," the County Carlow handler told At The Races."We're looking forward to Cheltenham in November with him. He'll go there with his chance. He's in great form and I couldn't have him any better."
