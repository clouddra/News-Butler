Maxios: Ran below parConnections of Maxios feel the testing conditions contributed to the French raider's dismal display in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on Saturday.Already a dual Group One winner this season having landed both the Prix d'Ispahan and the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp on an easy surface, the Jonathan Pease-trained five-year-old appeared to hold strong claims of striking again on Champions Day.However, the son of Monsun trailed home in eighth position, beaten 26 lengths by Olympic Glory, who had previously been comfortably behind Maxios in the Moulin.Alan Cooper, racing manager for owners the Niarchos Family, said: "He's on his way home and we'll obviously have him checked over once he arrives to see if there is anything amiss."At the moment there is nothing obvious, but Stephane (Pasquier) said he wasn't happy on the track even going down to the start. It was really testing."It was clearly too bad a run to be true when you had a 30-length turnaround in the form (compared to the Prix du Moulin)."We'll just feel our way with him. It is a possibility he could stay in training next year, but we'll check him out and have a chat at a later date."
