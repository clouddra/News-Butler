FETHARD, Ireland (AP) -- Double classic winner Camelot has been retired from horse racing after getting injured in training for next month's Breeders' Cup Turf.The Ireland-based Coolmore stable says in a statement released Monday that last year's 2,000 Guineas and English Derby champion ''was found to be lame pulling out this morning,'' meaning he wouldn't have been able to stay in training for the Nov. 2 race at Santa Anita.Camelot became only the third horse since Nijinsky in 1970 to achieve the Guineas-Derby double, but lost to Encke in the St. Leger in his bid to win the Triple Crown of English classics in 2012.Camelot has struggled since then, winning only one of three starts this season after failing to recover fully from a bad bout of colic.
