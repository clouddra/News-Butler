Chief Barker: Set for HQ returnChief Barker could be given the first chance to redeem himself in the Feilden Stakes at Newmarket after losing his unbeaten tag in the Racing Post Trophy.The Richard Hannon-trained colt had earned a crack at a Group One after beating subsequent Fillies' Mile and Breeders' Cup heroine Chriselliam at Haydock, only to disappoint at Doncaster when only sixth to Kingston Hill.Connections are unsure whether the soft ground was to blame or if Chief Barker is not up to that level."His half-sister Salford Art bombed in soft. When you look at horses by Azamour they are better on top of the ground, so for all we thought soft ground would bring out his stamina it worked against Chief Barker on the day," said Tim Palin racing manager of owners Middleham Park Racing."He didn't quite go through the ground, although we could be guilty of looking for an excuse and the answer could be very simple in that he's not up to that level, but the Chriselliam form suggests he is up to that level."We'll probably come back and start him in the Feilden Stakes over nine furlongs in April with his Listed penalty."It's usually decent ground there. An extra furlong will suit him. It's a good place to start and we'll take it from there. If he does well there we'll look at a Classic Trial at Sandown, Lingfield, the Dante, something like that. He will have to pass that (Feilden) test first."If he can't beat Listed performers giving them 2lb or 3lb then he's probably not up to it. The jury is slightly out whether he is good enough or if it was the ground. We think it was the ground, but we could be wrong."
