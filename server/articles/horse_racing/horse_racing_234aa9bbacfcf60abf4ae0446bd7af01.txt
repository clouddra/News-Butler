ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Fanticola won the $51,000 feature by a half-length at Santa Anita on Thursday.Ridden by Joe Talamo, Fanticola ran 6 1/2 furlongs on the hillside turf course in 1:13 and paid $20.60, $12.20 and $8.60 at 9-1 odds. It was trainer Mike Mitchell's second win on the card.''She's a fast filly,'' Talamo said. ''There was a lot of speed in there today, but you can put her wherever you want her. She tracked a couple of horses on the lead and when we crossed the dirt turning for home, she was great through there.''Talamo is 2-for-2 aboard the 3-year-old Canada-bred filly, having won on the turf at Del Mar.Moulin de Mougin returned $5.60 and $4.20, while Zanbo was another length back in third and paid $5 to show.The victory, worth $30,600, increased Fanticola's career earnings to $113,600, with two wins in five starts.
