Side Glance: Set for the Cox PlateSide Glance will become the latest Australian runner for Sheikh Fahad Al Thani when he runs in Saturday's Sportingbet Cox Plate.The Sheikh's colours have been carried to victory in both the Melbourne Cup and the Caulfield Cup by Dunaden in recent years and that has helped fuel an increase in the Sheikh's operations in Australia.Through his racing interests in Qatar Bloodstock and Pearl Bloodstock, Sheikh Fahad has not only increased his participation in the Spring Racing Carnival but he's also racing horses in Australia on a more regular basis while also increasing his interests on the breeding side.David Redvers told springracingcarnival.com.au that the operation had been 'spoiled' by Dunaden's successes and confirmed that their interest in Australia was growing."Australia has a huge commercial upside for our breeding operation as a part of our worldwide strategy so from that perspective we have been investing there as well", he noted."At the moment we have around 20 horses in training in Australia plus Harbour Watch standing at Emirates Park Stud and Makfi in New Zealand."One of the reasons why we have sent Havana Gold to run in the Emirates Stakes is that he is an exciting young stallion prospect with the possibility of advertising him to the Australian market as well."The Prix Jean Prat winner is due to line up in the Group One Emirates Stakes at Flemington on November 9 and Redvers is hopeful of a big run."He's one of the best three-year-old milers certainly in France and we thought that given that he likes quicker ground we might as well send him to Australia as the racing conditions will suit him ideally", he said.It is not only the 'big three' of the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups and the Cox Plate that has attracted Sheikh Fahad but also the strength of the Australian racing industry."Australian racing is very well financed from the prizemoney perspective but the industry offers great commercial opportunities as well", Redvers commented."Nearly every yearling we have bought in Australia have been well bred fillies with a view to winning races and building up a nice broodmare list to support our stallions going forward to build our commercial interests."Those interests could gain further momentum were Side Glance to defy his odds and complete a famous victory on Saturday.
