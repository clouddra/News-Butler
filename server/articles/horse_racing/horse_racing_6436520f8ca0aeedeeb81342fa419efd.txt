Johnny Murtagh: Trained and Rode Champions Day winnerJohnny Murtagh paid tribute to Royal Diamond who goes under the hammer next week after giving him his first success as a trainer in Britain.The trainer/jockey got the seven-year-old gelding, owned by Andrew Tinkler, up in the very last stride to deny Harris Tweed in the Qipco British Champions Long Distance Cup at Ascot last Saturday.Royal Diamond remained in England ahead of the Autumn Horses In Training Sale at Tattersalls on Monday."Royal Diamond is in the sales on Monday, so he stayed in England after Ascot," said the County Kildare handler."He's a great horse and we've been delighted to have him. He really settled into the place and has been so consistent this year. That's all you can ask for."It was a great win at Ascot and it meant a lot - to train him and to ride him."There were a couple of decisions to be made during the year and we made all the right ones."
