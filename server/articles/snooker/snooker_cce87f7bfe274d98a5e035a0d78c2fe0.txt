    Stephen Lee says he is going to employ a lawyer to prove his innocence after he was 
    
banned for 12 years for match-fixing.
    The former world number five 
    
was found guilty of seven match-fixing charges, 

     and has also been told to pay Â£40,000 costs.
    Speaking outside his house, Lee admits he is "absolutely devastated" with the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association's decision, and says he will be making a public statement later on Wednesday.
