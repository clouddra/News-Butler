    Aditya Mehta became the first Indian to reach the semi-finals of a ranking event with a 4-3 win over countryman Pankaj Advani at the Indian Open.
    Mehta, 27, will now face Scotland's world number five 
        Stephen Maguire,

     of China will play England's
         Robbie Williams

     in the other semi-final in Delhi.
    Williams, ranked 73rd in the world, beat Anthony McGill 4-0 while Ding was a 4-2 winner over Neil Robertson.
    "A couple of years ago, no-one would have imagined that an Indian player could win a ranking title, but now I'm only two matches away," said Mehta.
    "If I do win, I hope it will be a great thing for Indian sport. I want to be the first Indian to win a ranking title and to be sitting here tomorrow night with the trophy. The job is not done and I don't want to stop now."
    Seven players - Ali Carter, Dave Gilbert, Tony Drago, Anthony Hamilton, Kyren Wilson, Yu De Lu and Liam Highfield - withdrew from the tournament for various reasons, but organisers said it had nothing to do with 
    
the cyclone that swept through the Bay of Bengal.
