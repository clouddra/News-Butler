    Five-time world snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan says he turned down a Â£20,000 offer to fix a match as it would have meant "losing friends and family".
    In an interview with BBC Sport, O'Sullivan goes on to say that "snooker's given me a great life. It's not just about the money."
    The revelation that he was approached to fix a match comes less than a month after former world top-five player 
    
Stephen Lee was handed a 12-year ban 

     after being found guilty of seven match-fixing charges.
