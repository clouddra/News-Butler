    Ding Junhui won the Indian Open title with a 5-0 victory over home hope Aditya Mehta in Delhi.
    The Chinese world number four, 26, scored two century breaks as he earned the £50,000 first prize.
    Mehta, 72nd in the world, became 
    
the first Indian player to make the last four of a major ranking event 

     when he reached the semi-finals on Thursday.
    He knocked out former world champions Peter Ebdon and Mark Williams on the way, collecting £25,000 as runner-up.
    The 27-year-old defeated former world number two Stephen Maguire 4-3 in the semi-final, scoring a highest break of 132.
    But he could not match Ding, who followed a steady run of 52 in the opening frame with breaks of 81, 107, 93 and 100 to clinch victory.
    Earlier on Friday, Ding beat England's Robbie Williams 4-1 in his semi-final.
