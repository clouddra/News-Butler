Despite the setback, O'Sullivan was in an upbeat mood and hinted he is keen on overhauling Stephen Hendry's record of seven world titles."I'm enjoying my game now more than ever. I've never been one to set myself targets but there are dreams," he told www.worldsnooker.com."To break Hendry's record (of world titles) is something that has crossed my mind. I need another two to equal it or three to beat it."The way I feel I've played the last two years, I'm hitting the ball better than I have for 20 years, so at least I'm able to play all the shots and be aggressive."
