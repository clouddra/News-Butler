Alan McManus set up a last-32 match against Ryan DayDefending champion Judd Trump crashed out of the International Championship in Chengdu at the last-64 stage, beaten 6-5 by Scottish veteran Alan McManus.Trump did not play badly and led 4-3 at one point, helped by breaks of 92, 102 and 51, before McManus levelled with a 75 and then went 5-4 in front.Another Trump century, 110 this time, forced a decider, but McManus won it with runs of 23 and 31, setting up a clash with Ryan Day.Trump told the World Snooker website: "He played well and that's just the way it's going at the moment. I haven't had a great season so far, everyone seems to play well against me."A bit of luck here and there can make the difference and there were a couple of times today when Alan got away with bad shots, and I didn't."Former Masters champion McManus said: "I was behind a few times but there was never more than a frame in it."There was a lot of good stuff. Judd played well in patches and I was hanging on and chasing him. I was glad to get a couple of chances in the last frame."World No 1 Neil Robertson, who lost to Trump in the final last year, was 5-0 up against Alex Davies in his last-64 match, but was pegged back to 5-4.However, the Australian then produced a break of 128, his second ton of the match, to wrap up a 6-4 victory.Mark Selby was a 6-0 winner over Jamie Burnett but World No 6 Shaun Murphy is out, having lost 6-4 to David Gilbert.
