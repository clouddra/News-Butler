    Worried sponsors have contacted snooker's governing's body following Ronnie O'Sullivan's comments that corruption in the sport is rife.
    World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association chairman Jason Ferguson called the five-time world champion's claims "absolute rubbish".
    He also told him to act "in a manner befitting a professional sportsman".
    O'Sullivan has retracted the claims he made after 
    
Stephen Lee was found guilty of seven counts of match-fixing.
    WPBSA chairman Ferguson said: "We have had contact from sponsors concerned about Ronnie O'Sullivan's comments, that have now been retracted and were without substance.
    "I travel the world promoting a sport that involves gentlemanly behaviour and fair play, and I have had comments expressing serious concern."
    Following the verdict on Lee last week, 
    
O'Sullivan tweeted:Â  

     "I've heard there's many more players who throw snooker matches."
    A few days later he claimed his comments 
    
were taken out of context 

     and that he had no intention of damaging the integrity of the sport.
    Ferguson added: "We have worked very hard to get snooker clean. When someone comes out with absolute rubbish it undermines the good work and it isn't just anyone, it is our world champion."
