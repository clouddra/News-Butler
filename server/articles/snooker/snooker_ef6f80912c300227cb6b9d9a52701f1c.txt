    BBC Sport's Chris Mitchell talks to India's top two professional players Aditya Mehta and Pankaj Advani as their country prepares to host its first world ranking snooker tournament.
    Both players train at an elite facility set up for global players in Sheffield.
    Mehta and Advani hope the Indian Open, taking place in New Delhi from 14-18 October, will open the sport up to new players, with Mehta describing it as a "game changer."
