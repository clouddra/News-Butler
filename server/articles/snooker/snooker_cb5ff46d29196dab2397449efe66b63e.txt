    Snooker player Mark King says he "hasn't got any sympathy" for Stephen Lee, who has been 
    
banned for 12 years for match-fixing.
    Former world number five Lee 
    
was found guilty of seven match-fixing charges, 

     and has also been told to pay Â£40,000 costs.
    King believes Lee has brought "shame" on snooker, and hopes other players are deterred from fixing matches.
