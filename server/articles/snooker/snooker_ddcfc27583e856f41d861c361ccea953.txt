Stuart Bingham: Beaten by 21-year-old Kyren WilsonKyren Wilson and Xiao Guodong produced stunning displays to dump Stuart Bingham and Stephen Maguire out of the Shanghai Masters at the first-round stage.Xiao gave the home fans something to cheer with a 5-2 win over Maguire - but Wilson's was arguably the performance of the day as the 21-year-old Kettering potter marked his first appearance at the final stages of a ranking event by thumping Bingham 5-1.He could even have added a 147 break in frame four, but missed the 13th black after making 97.That was more than enough for a four-frame lead and although Bingham pulled one back in the next, a run of 54 in frame six sealed Wilson's win.
