    China's Ding Junhui stayed on course for a third successive ranking title with a 6-3 win over Peter Ebdon in their International Championship quarter-final in Chengdu.
    Ding is aiming to become the first man since Stephen Hendry in 1990 to win three major ranking events in a row.
    He needed over four hours to beat Ebdon and will face Scotland's 
        Graeme Dott

     in the last four.
    Dott, whose last tournament win was in 2007, beat Liang Wenbo 6-3.

“I have a lot of Chinese fans. Unfortunately I let them down most of the time”
    The 36-year-old, world champion in 2006, put together breaks of 97, 82 and 91 to see off Liang, 
    
who had knocked out Ronnie O'Sullivan 

     in the second round. 
     Mark Selby's

     hopes of adding the International Championship to his UK and Masters titles were dashed by Hong Kong's 
        Marco Fu.

    Selby went down 6-5 to Fu after failing to capitalise on a 5-3 lead.
    "I managed to stay calm when I was trailing 5-3, and hoped to recover step by step," said Fu, who made breaks of 84 and 112 to win in style.
    He will now face 
        Joe Perry,

     who beat Ryan Day 6-1, in the semis.

Fu told worldsnooker.com:  

     "This will be my first semi-final at a ranking tournament in China. 
    "I lost first-round matches many times and my best performance here was quarter-finals. I have made a breakthrough this time and hopefully I can do better tomorrow. 
    "I really want to have a good run here because I have a lot of Chinese fans. Unfortunately I let them down most of the time. I hope my momentum goes on."
    Perry lost the first frame against Welshman Day but then reeled off the next six.
    "I saw how well Ryan played yesterday so I expected a really tough game today," said Perry. "He has beaten me a few times in the past. I knew I'd have to play well today, and luckily I did."
