    Five-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan will not confirm whether he intends to play in next year's World Championship.
    The 37-year-old says he still "loves" snooker but admits to feeling "trapped" by the sport.
    O'Sullivan confirms his intention to play in a few "minor" tournaments this season but will not commit to defending his Crucible crown.
