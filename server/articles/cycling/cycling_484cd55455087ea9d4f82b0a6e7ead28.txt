I am certain that all the facts will soon be completely clarified."Those who know me also know that I hold the trust of fans and of people involved in the industry. I have always worked with greatest transparency and honesty, as well as with total dedication and loyalty to the RCS Group."Acquarone joined RCS Sport five years ago and has been race director of the Giro since 2011.He is now hoping his name will be cleared and that he can return to his role as soon as possible.His statement added: "I only dream about the day I can return to my team, and get back to working towards the 2014 Giro d'Italia, with even greater enthusiasm than that which has driven me over these years."RCS Sport is part of the RCS MediaGroup and organises other sporting events such as the Milan City Marathon.Its chief executive officer, Giacomo Catano, was also suspended in the wake of the revelations, while chairman Flavio Biondi tendered his resignation.
