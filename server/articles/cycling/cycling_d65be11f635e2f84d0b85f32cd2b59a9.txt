Andreas Kloden won Paris-Nice, the Tour of Romandie and Tirreno-AdriaticoVeteran German rider Andreas Kloden has announced his retirement from cycling after a 16-year career in which he twice finished runner-up at the Tour de France.The 38-year-old also won Paris-Nice in 2000 and finished third in the Sydney Olympics road race later that season.Kloden told German media that his failure to find a new team for 2014 and a desire to spend more time with his wife and two daughters were the key factors behind his decision.Kloden rode alongside Jan Ullrich, Alberto Contador and Lance Armstrong during his career, and also won Tirreno-Adriatico, the Tour of Romandie and the Tour of the Basque Country.His later years in cycling were dogged by allegations of doping, which angered him to such an extent that he cut off almost all contact with the media.He denied the accusations and told the Weser-Kurier newspaper: "I have nothing to confess."Kloden spent the final year of his career with the RadioShack-Leopard team and finished 30th at this year's Tour de France.
