Canada were [almost] five seconds slower in the qualifiers, so we are looking to exceed the team and maybe go for the catch."Great Britain's men's team pursuit squad will also race for gold tonight after being the only team to dip under four minutes in qualifying.Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, Andy Tennant and Owain Doull clocked a time of 3:59.672 over 4km and will face Australia in the final, who were 1.8 seconds slower.
