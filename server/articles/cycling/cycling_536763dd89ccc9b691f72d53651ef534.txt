Jason Kenny had to settle for silver

Jason Kenny had to settle for silverThey were Britain's seventh and eighth medals of the three-day championships in Apeldoorn.Both Trott and Wild finished the six-event omnium on 15 points, but the Briton took the title due to having a lower overall time from the flying lap, individual pursuit and 500m time trial.The duo faced off against each other in the final event of the competition, the 500m time trial, with Trott trailing Wild in the overall standings by five points and needing to finish at least five places in front of her rival to be in with a chance of winning gold.The Olympic champion recorded the second-fastest time in the field, but Wild managed to clock the seventh-fastest time to ensure both riders finished level on points.
