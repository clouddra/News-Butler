Mark Cavendish (l) and Bradley Wiggins celebrate world title success on the track in Manchester in 2008Road stars Mark Cavendish and Sir Bradley Wiggins have been warned they may have to commit themselves to a lengthy period of track training, if they wish to be considered for the pursuit event at the 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil.Last year's Tour de France champion Wiggins and 25-time stage winner Cavendish have expressed an interest in returning to the four-man, four-kilometre pursuit team in Rio.But London 2012 gold medal winner Steven Burke, a likely British team member at the next Games, said: "They'll have to commit to the track, not just have a road programme."It's very unlikely you can do both in the same year."At Olympic level, when you're going for three minutes, 50 seconds in the pursuit, you want to be at optimum level. You need to commit more to the track."And two-time Olympic team pursuit champion Ed Clancy had a similar message for the high-profile pair: "They've both voiced ideas about coming back in."Cav was talking about riding the Tour in 2015 and from then on in, for 12 months, dedicating himself as a track rider."But it's his call. Like Brad, he's got good things going on on the road and it will be up to them if they do decide to come back or not."If they do, they'll have to fight for their place. It will be up to those guys, whether they'll want to commit."
