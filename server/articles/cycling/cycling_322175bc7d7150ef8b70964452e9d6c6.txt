Jason Kenny: Yet to win a team world titleThree-time Olympic champion Jason Kenny hopes Great Britain can finally land a men's team sprint gold medal at the Track Cycling World Championships.Britain have picked up two Olympic titles in the three-man, three-lap team sprint, but have not claimed world gold since Los Angeles in 2005.This weekend's Track World Cup in Manchester will give an indication of the team's form ahead of February's World Championships in Colombia and Kenny is keen to add to his two individual world titles."I do want to win world titles," said Kenny, the reigning Keirin world champion."It frustrates me that we don't win more, particularly in the team sprint."It's pretty poor considering we've won two Olympics in the meantime, which should be harder than a World Championships."In the last few years we haven't even been close, which is quite frustrating."I'd like to go into Rio as favourites, as opposed to going into Rio praying for a miracle, like we did in London and Beijing."It would be good to go in as favourites, with a few world titles behind us and looking strong."
