Ryder Hesjedal: Has received support from his team Garmin-SharpGiro d'Italia winner Ryder Hesjedal has confessed to doping after allegations by fellow rider Michael Rasmussen.Rasmussen claimed in his autobiography that he taught Hesjedal how to take the banned blood-booster erythropoietin while he was a mountain bike rider in 2003.Hesjedal, who won last year's Giro d'Italia, admitted he doped 'more than 10 years ago', but insists he was not a long-term user.A statement from the Garmin-Sharp rider read: "I have loved and lived this sport but more than a decade ago I chose the wrong path."Even though those mistakes happened more than 10 years ago, and they were short-lived, it does not change the fact I made them and I have lived with that and been sorry for it ever since."I believe that being truthful will help the sport continue to move forward, and over a year ago when I was contacted by anti-doping authorities, I was open and honest about my past."The Canadian was one of several riders called on to testify by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in the case against Lance Armstrong, who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for doping.Having joined Garmin, a team with a strong anti-doping stance, Hesjedal remains confident the sport is on the right path."I have seen the best and the worst of the sport and I believe that it is now in the best place it's ever been," he said.Rasmussen was kicked out of his Rabobank team while leading the Tour de France in 2007 after lying about his whereabouts to doping authorities.Garmin-Sharp have stood by Hesjedal and a statement read: "As we have previously stated, our expectation is that anyone in our organisation contacted by any anti-doping authority must be open and honest with that authority."Ryder is no exception and a year ago when he was contacted he cooperated fully and truthfully testified to USADA and CCES (Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport)."For this reason and because of our desire for 100 percent truth and reconciliation in the sport of cycling, we support him."
