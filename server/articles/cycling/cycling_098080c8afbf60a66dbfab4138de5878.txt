We want to put the best nine riders on the line and, for sure, Bradley in good shape could be there."When you have a team of winners and you put two great riders like Bradley and Chris together it is a challenge, but they are working on it and I think Bradley can do it for sure."He aimed for the Giro last year, and not particularly the Tour, so we have got to get his goals for next year and we will plan from there really."Froome won the 2013 race in emphatic style and has been widely tipped to dominate the Tour de France for the next few years.However, he will face stiff competition from the likes of the ever-maturing Nairo Quintana and Giro d'Italia winner Vincenzo Nibali, who is returning to the Tour after a year's absence.Ellingworth added: "Chris has done a great job the last couple of years and his win this year just proved he is a fantastic Tour de France rider."With riders like Nibali saying he is going to do the Tour, I think we are going to have a great race on our hands next year, but I think Chris can continue to win for sure."
