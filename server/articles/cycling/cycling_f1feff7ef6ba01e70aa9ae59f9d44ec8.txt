The women's team pursuit squad will look to add to their European title on home boardsGreat Britain have named a full-strength team for the opening round of the UCI Track Cycling World Cup in Manchester.The three-day event, which takes place at the National Cycling Centre from November 1-3, is the first of three World Cup meetings between now and the World Championships in Colombia in February.Britain will field almost the same team that collected eight medals and finished second in the medal table at last weekend's European Track Championships in the Netherlands.The only omission from the squad is Katie Archibald, who formed part of the gold medal-winning team pursuit line-up but will represent her trade team in Manchester instead.The British team includes Olympic champions Laura Trott, Dani King, Joanna Rowsell, Jason Kenny, Ed Clancy and Steven Burke, as well as double world champion Becky James.Performance manager Shane Sutton said: "We came home from the European Track Championships with three gold, two silver and three bronze medals, which has given us a solid start to the season."We will be looking to build on that over the next couple of weeks, and I am hoping to see some good performances across the board at the World Cup in Manchester."To compete at an event at our home velodrome is always a big boost to the team and it is without a doubt our favourite venue to race at. All of the team are looking forward to racing with the support of a home crowd again."Men's sprint: Matt Crampton, Kian Emadi, Jason Kenny, Phil Hindes.Women's sprint: Becky James, Jess Varnish, Vicky Williamson.Men's endurance: Steven Burke, Ed Clancy, Jon Dibben, Owain Doull, Sam Harrison, Andy Tennant.Women's endurance: Elinor Barker, Dani King, Joanna Rowsell, Laura Trott.
