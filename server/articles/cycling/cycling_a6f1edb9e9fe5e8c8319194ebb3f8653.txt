Gabriel Rasch is set for a new role with Team SkyGabriel Rasch will become a Sports Director for Team Sky during 2014 and retire from professional cycling after the cobbled Classics campaign.The 37-year-old Norwegian joined Team Sky for the 2013 season and has played an important role both on and off the bike, helping the team to five victories including Chris Froome's Tour de Romandie triumph and Edvald Boasson Hagen's defence of the Tour of Norway.Throughout his time with the team, Rasch has mentored many of the younger professionals and passed on valuable experience from his six seasons in the professional peloton.Speaking of his move, Rasch said: "I'd always hoped to become a Sports Director once my riding days had come to a close and this is a big chance for me to do what I'd love to do with a team that I love."It's great that Team Sky give riders like me a chance to develop and I'd like to thank Sir Dave Brailsford and the management for all their support. I'm looking forward to repaying their trust in me."I have good relationships with my team-mates, management and the coaching staff and I'm sure they'll help make my move to a Sports Director as smooth as possible."No one ever wants to stop riding but this is the right time and the right opportunity to pass on some of my experience."However, I'm not hanging up the bike just yet; I plan to fight for my place up until Paris-Roubaix and after that I will become a full-time DS for the team. I can't wait to get started".Team Sky Performance Manager, Rod Ellingworth, said: "We recognised early on that Gabba had a lot of the qualities that we look for in a Sports Director. He has an excellent work ethic, great cycling experience, and a calm and considered approach. He knows exactly how the team works and we know he'll do an excellent job for us."Gabba will join the DS team fresh from the bike which will make all the difference and will help him settle in quickly. This is an opportunity for him to pass on the huge amount of racing knowledge that he has accumulated over the years and pass it on to the younger riders - which I know he will relish."There's still a bit racing left in Gabba and we'll continue to support his ambitions to race in the Classics next year. Then he'll take on the Sports Director role full time. He's going to be a great addition to the DS team and we're all looking forward to working with him in the 2014 season".
