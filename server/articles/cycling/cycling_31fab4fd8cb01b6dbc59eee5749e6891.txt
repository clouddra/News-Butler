BERLIN (AP) -- German cyclist Andreas Kloeden announced his retirement on Thursday after a 16-year professional career that included two runner-up finishes in the Tour de France.The 38-year-old Kloeden, who finished second in the Tour in 2004 and '06, told the Weser-Kurier newspaper he wants to spend more time with his wife and two daughters.Kloeden was the highest-finishing German, coming in 30th in his 12th Tour in July, when he raced for RadioShack. He told the DPA news agency that his failure to find a new team helped push him toward retirement.The German rode alongside Jan Ullrich, Alberto Contador and Lance Armstrong, winning eight pro stage races including Paris-Nice, Tirreno-Adriatico, Tour of Romandie and the Tour of the Basque Country on two occasions. He also claimed a bronze medal at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000.
