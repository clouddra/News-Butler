Millar told Wieler Revue: "It has been quite organic really. You always think it is going to be a definitive moment, but it hasn't. It has kind of crept up and I am suddenly realising it is time."I think my body is actually getting stronger. It is just I don't want it or need it as much as I once did. It is very much a conscious decision."I can still be on top of the game - I know that - but it is a lot harder for me now. I want to be on top of my game next year, so I know I can get that out of me. With the motivation of knowing it is my last year, I know I can get the best out of myself."Millar won stages of the Tour de France in 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2012, and also triumphed on five stages at the Vuelta a Espana and one at the Giro d'Italia.As well as being one of the most successful British cyclists of his generation, the Garmin-Sharp rider will also be remembered as a drugs cheat after admitting in 2004 to using EPO. After serving a two-year ban, he later became a vocal campaigner for clean cycling.Millar was a time-trial specialist and won the world title in the discipline in 2003, but saw his title stripped after his doping was exposed.
