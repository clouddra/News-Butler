Vincenzo Nibali already has Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana victories to his nameVincenzo Nibali will challenge Chris Froome at next year's Tour de France as he bids to become only the sixth rider in history to win all three Grand Tours.Nibali finished third in the 2012 Tour behind winner Bradley Wiggins and runner-up Froome but took a year off the race in 2013 to concentrate on the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana.He triumphed at the Giro in May in impressive style, but missed out on adding a second Vuelta title to the one he won in 2010 after being narrowly edged out by Chris Horner.Now, the Astana rider is turning his attentions back towards the Tour as he looks to emulate Jacques Anquetil, Felice Gimondi, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Alberto Contador in winning the Grand Tour treble.He told Gazzetta dello Sport: "I have not talked with my team and my programme has not decided yet. The only thing that is sure is that I will be back on the Tour."The Giro is a great race, but I want to focus on the Tour. I want to participate to win, for me and for all of Italy."The route for the 2014 Tour will be unveiled in Paris on Wednesday, October 23. It has already been announced that the Grand Depart will be held in England, with two days in Yorkshire being followed by a stage into London.
