Ma'a Nonu: Highlanders ace is out of contract and looking for a club ahead of the new seasonNew Zealand Rugby Union chief executive Steve Tew insists they are committed to ensuring Ma'a Nonu has a Super Rugby spot next season.The 31-year-old is out of contact although the Highlanders are not keen to welcome back the man who left in acrimonious circumstances at the end of the 2011 season.The Blues, Chiefs and Crusaders have all stated they are not interested in his services, however, a deal is yet to be finalised for the vastly-experienced international who has 81 caps to his name.While his Super Rugby form has been poor, Nonu remains key to the All Black cause and as such the NZRU are desperate to resolve his future. However, Tew says that no further news is available on the matter."As I've said on several occasions it frustrates the hell out of people but I can't do anything about it," Tew is quoted as saying by Newstalk ZB."This is a private employment matter, so until it's concluded I can't speculate on it, it's not fair on the individual and anyone who's talking to him."We have a number of players we're looking to re-sign and we're working hard on all of them."
