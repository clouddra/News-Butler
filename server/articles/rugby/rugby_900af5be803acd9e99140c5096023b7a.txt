    Stuart Lancaster says Chris Robshaw was right to step away from rugby over the summer even though it threatened to cost him the England captaincy.
    Robshaw opted to rest rather than tour Argentina with Lancaster's squad.
    But he has been 
    
reinstated as skipper for the autumn internationals 

     against Australia, Argentina and New Zealand after holding off Tom Wood's claims.
    Head coach Lancaster said: "It was the right thing to do. The pressures of captaining club and country are big."
    He added: "When I looked at him and spoke to him at the end of last season, while he was willing to go on tour, I felt a physical and mental break was important for him. And he's come back refreshed, to take on the role again.
    "We spoke about the end of the season, to give him some areas to develop. One was his foot speed over the floor, and his ability to change his pace.
    "He's worked on those. Harlequins have done a good job and he looks in great shape. To have a big back row in the modern game is handy, so he's got physicality as well, but I think he's a bit more dynamic as well."
    Robshaw had been 
    
omitted from the British and Ireland Lions squad 

     that secured a historic series win down under, and then had to watch as 
    
Wood captained England to win in their own series in Argentina.
    But Lancaster feels that process has left him in a better position as Australia come to town.
Wood captained England for the first time in the 2-0 series win over Argentina in June
