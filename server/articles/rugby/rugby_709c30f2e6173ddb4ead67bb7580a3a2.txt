The Vunipola brothers in Saracens coloursOwen Farrell admits he does not like facing the Vunipola brothers during training and says they have a big future in international rugby union.The Polynesian forwards are expected to be part of England's starting XV at Twickenham on Saturday when Australia are the opponents in the first of this autumn's three internationals.And while both siblings - Mako and Billy - have already worn a white England shirt under coach Stuart Lancaster, they are yet to be named in the same starting line-up.Mako, 22, and two years Billy's senior, is likely to play at loosehead prop while his brother is set to wear the No 8 jersey.Farrell is not only a member of the same England squad as Mako and Billy, he also plays for the same club side Saracens.The 22-year-old fly-half said: "They're both big lads. They're massive. I don't like tackling them in training."But it's not just that, they have good rugby brains as well. They know exactly what they're doing."Mako is the best rugby-playing prop I've ever seen and Billy is a big, big unit who has really good skills and feet. I don't see how you really stop it."I don't see how they can't go forward given the way they play. That's not just because of the size of them, but the knowledge and feel for the game that they have."What they do is go forward and everyone thinks that is just because they're so big and strong but it's also because of their knowledge and feel for the game."
