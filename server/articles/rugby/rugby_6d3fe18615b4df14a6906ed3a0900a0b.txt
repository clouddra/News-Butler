Coverage: Live BBC TV and online coverage of all England's group matches and Wales v Italy, plus one quarter-final, one semi-final and the final. All matches live on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra    Professor Tony Collins, a social historian at De Montfort University, tells the story of the Rugby League World Cup trophy that went missing from the Midland Hotel in Bradford after Australia beat Great Britain in the 1970 final.
    A new trophy had to be adopted for ensuing tournaments until the original was found 20 years later in a ditch in Bingley.
    The trophy has since been restored to its former glory and will be presented to the winner of this year's World Cup, which on 26 October.
    The journey of the trophy remains "one of the great mysteries of British sport", says Collins.
