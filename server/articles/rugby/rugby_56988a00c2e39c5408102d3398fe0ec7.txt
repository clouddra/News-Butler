It is the pinnacle in our sport and the more you get to do it the better."You look at the guys who have played 50 and 100 games and they're legends in our sport and in this country. Everyone is trying to strive towards that."There is also a really positive feeling within the group at the moment despite the result on the weekend not going our way. I really enjoy the way we are playing and it's a very fun way to play the game."Australia coach Ewen McKenzie added: "I'm really pleased about that and it's a good sign for Australian Rugby in the long haul."He is a guy who contributes every week and for example was players' player on the weekend against the All Blacks."
