COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier says quarterback Connor Shaw won't need surgery for his sprained left knee.But Shaw is unlikely to play when the 20th-ranked Gamecocks travel to No. 5 Missouri this weekend.Spurrier says Sunday that Shaw had on a knee brace and was walking some a day after injuring the knee in a 23-21 loss at Tennessee. However, Spurrier adds Shaw wouldn't practice for two to three days. Should Shaw make it back in time, it wouldn't be the first time the senior overcame injuries to play.Three weeks ago, Spurrier was told Shaw would miss up to three games because of a shoulder injury against UCF on Sept. 28. However, Shaw was back at practice two days later and played the next week against Kentucky.
