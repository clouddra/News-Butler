LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska quarterback Taylor Martinez probably will play against Minnesota on Saturday, but whether he starts will be a game-time decision.Coach Bo Pelini said Thursday that Martinez's availability will be determined by how his injured left foot responds to a week's worth of practice. Martinez has missed three straight games for the No. 25 Cornhuskers because of turf toe. Redshirt freshman Tommy Armstrong Jr. started in Martinez's place.The main concern is whether Martinez can fully plant his foot when he runs outside the pocket. Pelini said Martinez seemed to get better at that throughout the week.
