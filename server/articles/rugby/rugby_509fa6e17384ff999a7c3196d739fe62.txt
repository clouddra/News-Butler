The Miami Dolphins celebrate Cameron Wake's game-winning safetyCameron Wake snatched a dramatic 22-20 overtime victory for the Miami Dolphins as he sacked Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton for a safety.Wake came through the middle to tackle Dalton with 6:38 left in overtime for only the third overtime safety in NFL history.It was third sack of the match for Wake, while Paul Soliai also caught Dalton, who endured a disappointing night.The 26-year-old also threw three interceptions, fumbled once and completed 32-of-53 passes.The Bengals had taken the lead through Mike Nugent's 31-yard field goal in the second quarter before the Dolphins took control.Ryan Tannehill rushed over from a yard and Caleb Sturgis landed a 36-yard field goal to give Miami a 10-3 lead at the break.Brent Grimes ran in a 94-yard interception before the Bengals finally found a way back into the match.Gio Barnard rushed over from three yards and then from 35 yards to tie the scores.And Nugent looked to have won the game for Cincinnati as he kicked a 54-yard field goal with 1:24 remaining in regulation.Miami, though, forced overtime when Sturgis made a 44-yard field goal with 11 seconds left after a 50-yard drive.And the Dolphins snapped their four-game losing streak when Wake struck in overtime."I don't know if we could have gone another series, the engine light was on, tyre pressure warnings were going off, I just had to put the pedal to the metal and give it all, let the engine run out," Wake said.
