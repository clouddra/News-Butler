Steve Hansen: Nine wins in a row but still not satisfiedSteve Hansen says it is vital that the all-conquering New Zealand national team remain fully focused on making further improvements.The All Blacks coach insists they must never become complacent, as they prepare to face Australia in this Saturday's third and final Bledisloe Cup match in Dunedin.New Zealand, the reigning World Cup holders, have also secured back-to-back Rugby Championships with 100% records.They have won all nine Tests they have played during 2013 so far and have not lost at home to the Aussies for 12 years.This week's Bledisloe Cup game is a dead rubber, as the Kiwis are already in possession of the trophy having won the opening two meetings.But Hansen is not prepared to take his eye off the ball ahead of this weekend's clash in Otago: "The key message is we've got to progress forward from what we were in our last performance."If we sit and be comfortable then someone's going to come screaming past us."This team needs this game, this is an ideal game, because if we want to make statements, this a great opportunity."Because we've come off a great win (clinching the Rugby Championship in South Africa), everyone's given us a pat on the back."Now we've got two choices. We can either be like pigs in the mud and roll in it and say how good we are, or we can get back to work and say we want to improve our game."That seems to be the attitude within the group. You're never going to be perfect but you want to strive to be perfect. Whilst you've got that mindset you've got an opportunity to keep playing well."
