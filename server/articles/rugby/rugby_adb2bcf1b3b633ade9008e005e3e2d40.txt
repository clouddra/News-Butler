Well Australia prop Ben Alexander can't wait to run out at Twickenham on Saturday - he says the atmosphere is like nowhere else in the world.Australia prop Ben Alexander admits he is still haunted by his poor scrummaging display in the third Test defeat against the British and Irish Lions.The Lions destroyed the Wallabies' set-piece in Sydney, which resulted in a 41-16 victory for the tourists in the series decider.Alexander was sin-binned after 24 minutes and failed to return the pitch as Australia sought to escape more damage."After that third game I was devastated," Alexander said."I was looking forward to that series for such a long time. To lose the series the way we did, especially after the first two games were so close and well fought, hurts."For all the hype around the third game and for us to implode the way we did was just disappointing. I think the pressure got to us."We were like deer in the headlights with the way we played that third Test."With Alex Corbisiero sidelined through inury, Alexander is likely to lock horns with Mako Vunipola on Saturday.It's a duel that will be more to his liking after he won his battle with the Saracens loosehead during the second Lions Test in Melbourne, but he admits he will always be scarred by the outcome of the series."That arena has gone now and we'll never have the chance to beat the Lions," said Alexander."You just have to use it as fuel for the fire the next time there's a big occasion. You use that disappointment to train harder and prepare better."Watch England take on Australia this Saturday. Coverage starts on Sky 3D and Sky Sports 2 from 1.30pm.
