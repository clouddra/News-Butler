Bakkies Botha: Won the last of his 72 caps at the 2011 World CupSouth Africa have recalled the World Cup-winning trio of Bakkies Botha, Jaque Fourie and JP Pietersen for next month's autumn internationals.Veteran lock Botha, who has won 72 caps, has not featured for the Springboks since moving to Toulon after the 2011 World Cup.Fourie also last featured for South Africa at the World Cup in New Zealand and has been plying his trade in Japan, as has Pietersen, who hasn't played for the Boks this year.Along with the returning stalwarts, head coach Heyneke Meyer has selected four uncapped players for the Tests against Wales, Scotland and France.Hooker Scarra Ntubeni, prop Frans Malherbe, lock Pieter-Steph du Toit and scrum-half Louis Schreuder have all been included, while Gio Aplon and Johan Goosen are recalled to the 32-man squad."Scarra's inclusion, like that of Gio, is also just-reward for continuous great form," said Meyer. "He's still young and will learn a lot from our two front-line hookers, who both rate amongst the best in the world, on this tour."I want to expose him to this environment and the Springbok ethos and I'm very excited to work with him."It will be great to have Bakkies, Jaque and JP in the squad - all of them are really excited to play for the Springboks again, they have heaps of experience and are world-class players."South Africa begin their three-Test tour in Cardiff against Wales on 9 November and Meyer wants his side to build on their performances during the Rugby Championship."The Welsh have won the Six Nations the last two seasons," he said. "It's our first Test against them since the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and they will be fired up at the Millennium Stadium."South Africa squadForwards: W Alberts, B Botha, M Coetzee, B du Plessis, J du Plessis, PS du Toit, E Etzebeth, S Kolisi, F Louw, F Malherbe, T Mtawarira, S Ntubeni, C Oosthuizen, G Steenkamp, A Strauss, F van der Merwe, D Vermeulen.Backs: G Aplon, J de Villiers (capt), F du Preez, JJ Engelbrecht, J Fourie, J Goosen, B Habana, Z Kirchner, P Lambie, W le Roux, R Pienaar, JP Pietersen, L Schreuder, J Serfontein, M Steyn.
