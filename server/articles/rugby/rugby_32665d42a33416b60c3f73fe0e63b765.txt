Coverage: Live BBC TV and online coverage of all England's group matches and Wales v Italy, plus one quarter-final, one semi-final and the final. All matches live on BBC Radio 5 or 5 live sports extra    Wales coach Iestyn Harris says his squad are in good shape for their World Cup opener against Italy on 26 October.
    Harris' team warmed up for the tournament with a 62-12 victory over a Welsh Select XIII at Colwyn Bay's Eirias Park on Tuesday evening.
    It is Wales' only warm-up game but Harris said his side are ready for  Italy at the Millennium Stadium.
    "We're having a good build-up to the Italy game in Cardiff and everyone knows the structure," said Harris.
    "It's our priority to make sure our preparation is right and this week has allowed us to get that. 
    "Italy have talked themselves up in terms of what they're going to bring to the World Cup.
    "They've got some quality players in the squad and you know that they're going to test you in certain areas."
    Italy's squad includes players based in Australia's NRL - Anthony and Mark Minichiello, Aiden Guerra and Dean Parata.
    Wales' friendly followed a week of intense training in North Wales and Harris will be able to call on Wigan's Grand Final-winning forwards Ben Flower and Gil Dudson against Italy after they were rested on Tuesday night.
    "It has been a good week for us," added Harris, who believes his side are 
    
capable of reaching the quarter-finals.
    "We've hit a fair bit of intensity in training.
    "We had some sore bodies going into the game, which is what we wanted.
    "I'm happy with the squad at the moment. Some of the guys are a little dusty as they haven't played for four to five weeks so it was important for them to get this hit-out."
