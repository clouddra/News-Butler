Coverage: Score updates on BBC Local Radio and BBC Sport online.     Newcastle make seven changes from last week's 
    
Challenge Cup defeat at Brive.
    Former Scotland scrum-half Mike Blair returns to the side after being rested last week while prop Scott Lawson retains his place after debuting.
    London Irish have made 11 changes to the side that
    
 thrashed Lusitanos in the Challenge Cup 

     last week.
    Chris Hala'ufia has returned to the back row after recovering from knee ligament damage that has kept him out for the last six weeks. 
     Newcastle Falcons head coach Peter Russell told BBC Newcastle:

    "We played well against Brive and were ahead for large parts but didn't convert one or two opportunities when close to their try-line. 
    "London Irish are a different kettle of fish. They will field a very dangerous backline and we will need to cover that to stop them taking control of the game.
    "We just need to make sure we play our game. We have a lot of players back from injury so there'll be some disappointed boys this weekend that's for sure.
    "It's a good position to be in because we know the medical team have done a wonderful job to make sure players are only coming back in when they're firing at 100%."
