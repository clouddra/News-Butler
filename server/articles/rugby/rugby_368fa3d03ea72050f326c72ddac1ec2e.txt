EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Northwestern is apologizing for any misconceptions about uniforms it plans to wear against Michigan next week.The Wildcats will trade their familiar purple for the red, white and blue when they host the Wolverines on Nov. 16 to honor the Wounded Warrior Project, which supports wounded service members. The Under Armour jerseys with the stars and stripes will be auctioned off after the game, with all proceeds going to the Project.The uniforms show what to some look like blood stains on a flag. Northwestern spokesman Paul Kennedy said Monday it's a ''distressed pattern on both the stars and stripes that was inspired by the appearance of a flag that has flown proudly over a long period of time'' and apologized ''for any misinterpretation.'' He added Boston College used a similar design last year.
