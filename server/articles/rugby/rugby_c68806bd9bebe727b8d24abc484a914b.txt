    England got back to winning ways with the help of a scintillating first-half performance 
    
to beat Ireland 42-0 at the John Smith's Stadium in Huddersfield.
    They lost their Rugby League World Cup opener to Australia but a first half hat-trick from Ryan Hall ensured they remain on course for a semi-final spot.
    Tom Briscoe scored two tries with Brett Ferres, Kallum Watkins and Rangi Chase all crossing the white line as a rampant England ran in a total of eight tries to complete the rout.
