Jacques Burger: Big part of unbeaten Sarries sideSaracens flanker Jacques Burger has been named Aviva Premiership Player of the Month for September.The powerful Namibian has started the season in sparkling form, playing a pivotal role in Sarries almost managing the perfect month.Mark McCall's side won all four of their Premiership games and only once failed to claim a bonus point as they opened up a six-point lead over Northampton at the top of the table.Former England scrum-half and Aviva ambassador Austin Healey said: "Jacques has been simply outstanding in September."He has played with a hunger that can only be born out of a frustrating 18 months of injury."Both he and Saracens should be very proud of sticking through what I'm sure will have been dark times whilst getting back to full fitness."Saracens remain the only unbeaten side in the top flight and are also the joint-leading try scorers on 14 along with the Saints and Leicester.Burger claimed the September award ahead of Northampton centre Luther Burrell and Bath outside-half George Ford.
