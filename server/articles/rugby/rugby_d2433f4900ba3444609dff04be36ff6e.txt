     Jeremy, two simple questions. Which team gave the most impressive performance over the weekend, and which players stood out? When considering teams I would rate the Scarlets, Edinburgh or Exeter's performances as better than Toulon in so far as they exceeded expectation, whereas Toulon performed as expected. Not2serious

    I agree with your selections and also that the Toulon result was expected. The list of players who stood out for me is very long.
    I will pick out Scott Williams' performance for Scarlets in their match against Harlequins. His try was spectacular. It's not very often we see a centre dummy, show and go and sprint away from defenders to score. It was sheer class from the young man - he is definitely a superstar in the making.
     Jerry, I used to think that your Bath squad with 18 or 20 internationals could never be bettered as a club squad. However, having looked at the Toulon 23, and considered the others left out, this has to be the strongest club squad ever. Do you agree and how would they get on against the current Kiwi and South African national teams (I am taking beating the rest as read!)? Rellis
