Stuart Hogg: Suffered the injury in win over LeinsterScotland full-back Stuart Hogg is a major doubt for the autumn internationals after undergoing surgery on a wrist injury.Glasgow Warriors confirmed that the 21-year-old faces 'several weeks' out of action after picking up the injury in last week's win over Leinster.Hogg, who was one of only three Scotland players selected for the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, is not expected to recover in time for the clash with Japan at Murrayfield on November 9.Scotland then take on South Africa the following weekend, with Australia rounding off the autumn series on November 23.A statement on the Glasgow Warriors website read: "Hogg has undergone an operation on a wrist injury he picked up playing in the recent win against Leinster."He is expected to to be out of action for several weeks."Heach coach Scott Johnson is resigned to losing Hogg, but hopes another player will seize the chance to shine."Are we counting Hoggy out of the Autumn Tests? Yeah, probably. There is a chance that he might make a game but that is unlikely," said Johnson."However, this is just a chance to blood someone else."Johnson remains hopeful that Perpignan fly-half Tommy Allan will opt to represent Scotland, despite being called up for an Italy training camp.Allan has an Italian mother, but Johnson believes he might still represent the land of his Scottish father."Tommy was always on our radar," he said. "We haven't said anything else. We have been in dialogue with him but - and I will keep saying this - I will onlypick players who want to play for Scotland."It's not about a change of heart. The conversation we had will remain between myself and the lad. He's a young man caught in the middle of something."He's got to sort his mind out and we will give him time to do that."
