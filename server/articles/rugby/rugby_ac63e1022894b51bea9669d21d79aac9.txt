    The United States rugby league team - team nicknamed 'the Tomahawks' - are hoping to surprise a few people when they begin their World Cup campaign.
    The side, made up of Australian-based players and part-timers, have already created waves by beating France in a pre-tournament friendly and include Hawaii-based cultural entertainer Lelauloto Tagaloa among their ranks. 
    Their first match is against the Cook Islands at the Memorial Stadium in Bristol on Wednesday.
