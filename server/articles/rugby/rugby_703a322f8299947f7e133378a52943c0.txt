Nick Foles threw seven touchdown passes for the Philadelphia EaglesPhiladelphia quarterback Nick Foles tied the NFL record of touchdown passes as the Eagles routed the Oakland Raiders 49-20.The 24-year-old became the seventh quarterback in NFL history with seven TD passes in a game to kick-start the Eagles' faltering offensive game.Foles completed an impressive 22-of-28 passes for 406 yards, with Riley Cooper profiting to score a hat-trick of touchdowns.Foles connected with Brent Celek from two yards to get the Eagles off to a flying start.The Raiders (3-5) responded with a 24-yard field goal from Sebastian Janikowski, however back-to-back touchdowns from Cooper - from 17 and 63-yard passes - moved the Eagles clear.An eight-yard run from Rashad Jennings, who rushed for 102 yards in total, gave Oakland hope but Foles' 15-yard scoring pass to Zach Ertz cancelled it out.Janikowski landed a 53-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 28-13, however three touchdowns in the third quarter from the Eagles killed the game as a contest.Foles connected with LeSean McCoy from 25 yards, DeSean Jackson from 46 yards and Cooper from five yards to emulate Peyton Manning's seven TD passes for Denver on the opening night of the season.There was some consolation for the Raiders as Jeremy Stewart crossed from two yards out for a late touchdown but it was too little too late.
