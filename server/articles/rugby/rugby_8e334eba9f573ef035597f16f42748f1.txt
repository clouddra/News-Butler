Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano talks to Mike GlennonTampa Bay Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano faces an uncertain future after his team slumped to 0-7 with a 31-13 defeat to the surging Carolina Panthers.The Bucs are one of two NFL clubs who are yet to win this season, while they have tasted victory just once in their past 13 games.And the manner of their loss to the Panthers - who have now won three successive games - will have heaped the pressure on second-year coach Schiano, with only a late touchdown adding some respectability to scoreline.Cam Newton led the way for the Panthers, as he completed 23-of-32 passes for 221 yards and two touchdowns, while he also rushed for 50 yards.The 24-year-old connected with Greg Olsen from a yard for the opening score and although Rian Lindell responded with a 47-yard field goal Carolina took control as DeAngelo Williams ran in from 12 yard to make it 14-3.Lindell was on target with a 48-yard field goal before the interval to at least give the Bucs a glimmer of hope.However Newton scooted over from six yards and the found Mike Tolbert with a three-yard TD pass to put the game out of sight.Graham Gano tagged on a 29-yard field goal before Mike Glennon's 10-yard pass to Timothy Wright finally saw the Bucs cross for a touchdown.Glennon struggled to connect with any of his receivers, though, completing 30-of-51 passes for 275 yards.
