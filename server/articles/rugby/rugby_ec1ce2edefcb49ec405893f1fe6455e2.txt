    Ulster hooker Rory Best is delighted after the Irish province's fine 25-8 victory away to Montpellier made it two wins from two in the Heineken Cup.
    Best said there were a lot of bruised bodies in the visitors' dressing room after a tough physical encounter against a strong French side.
    Although happy with the result, Best stressed the importance of Ulster producing similarly strong performances at the business end of the season in April and May.
