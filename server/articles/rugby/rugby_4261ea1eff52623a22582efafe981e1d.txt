    Coach Mark Anscombe says Ulster's 25-8 win away to Montpellier was just reward for a thoroughly professional display.
    Anscombe was pleased that his team stuck to the game plan against a strong French side in Pool Five of the Heineken Cup.
    Ulster, beaten finalists in the 2011/12 season, are top of the pool with two wins from two.
