Mike Phillips: Doubts over future at BayonneBritish and Irish Lions scrum-half Mike Phillips' future at Bayonne has once again been cast in doubt.The French club have confirmed that Phillips has been suspended over an alleged breach of discipline but have denied press reports that the Wales international had been sacked.Bayonne say no decision has been taken yet on Phillips' future, but confirmed he will remain absent when they host Montpellier on Friday.Phillips appeared before the Bayonne board this week to answer allegations he turned up to a team meeting under the influence of alcohol.Team-mates Dwayne Haare and Stephen Brett are also understood to have been implicated and have been fined but not suspended while Phillips has been left out of the matchday 22 for Friday's Top 14 game.He said: "Sorry to all the fans of Bayonne for this situation, I agree wholeheartedly with the team for tomorrow night. good luck."It is not the first time that Phillips has found himself in trouble for off-field misdemeanours.He was suspended by Bayonne last year for off-field misconduct, and was also in trouble with Wales in 2011 following an incident in Cardiff city centre.
