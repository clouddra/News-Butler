    Back-row forward Juan Manuel Leguizamon will captain Argentina against England at Twickenham on Saturday in the absence of Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe.
    Fernandez Lobbe, 31, has been ruled out of the Pumas' three Autumn Tests in Europe with an elbow injury.
    "I'm happy with the responsibility I've been given and hope to carry it out to the best of my ability," said Lyon No.8 Leguizamon, who has won 52 caps.
Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe has captained Argentina since November 2008
