Francois Steyn: To undergo minor back surgerySharks back Francois Steyn is set to undergo minor surgery after missing out on selection for South Africa's November Tests.Steyn played at inside centre for the Sharks as they won the Currie Cup Final last weekend against Western Province.The 26-year-old versatile back underwent surgery in May on a heavy pressure build-up in his leg, in an injury sustained playing against the Highlanders.Now having not been selected by the Springboks, the Sharks have made the decision for Steyn to have a scope on the previous operation that will rule him out for three weeks, according to reports.The operation means that Steyn will be fit for the Sharks pre-season training ahead of next season's Super Rugby tournament.
