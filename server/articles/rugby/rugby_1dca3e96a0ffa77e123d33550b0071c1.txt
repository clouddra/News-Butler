John Fox: Will be absent from Denver Broncos for several weeksDenver Broncos coach John Fox will miss several weeks after falling ill on Saturday and being told he needs to bring forward plans to have heart surgery.Fox complained of feeling light-headed while playing golf at Quail Hollow during his side's bye week, and he was taken to hospital where tests revealed he needed aortic heart valve replacement.The 58-year-old later revealed he had been planning to undergo surgery at the end of the season but the incident has brought forward that timetable.Fox has led the Broncos to a 7-1 record on the back of record-breaking performances from veteran quarterback Peyton Manning, and he hopes not to be absent from the team for too long.He said: "Although I am disappointed I must take some time away from the team to attend to this pre-existing health condition, I understand that it's the right thing to do."I have great confidence in our coaches and players, who are fully committed to our goals. I look forward to returning to coaching as soon as possible."I sincerely appreciate all of the support from friends, Denver Broncos fans and so many around the league."
