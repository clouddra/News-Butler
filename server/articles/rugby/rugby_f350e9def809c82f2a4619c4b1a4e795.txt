Dean Ryan: Double injury blowWorcester have been hit by a double blow with No 8 Semisi Taulava and centre Ravai Fatiaki both suffering injuries.Taulava will be out for two months after suffering a knee injury and Fatiaki will be out of action for a month with an ankle injury.Both men were hurt in the Warriors' 16-11 defeat to Newcastle, further bad news for new Worcester coach Dean Ryan whose team are bottom of the Aviva Premiership having lost all five games this season.Ryan said: "We've lost Semisi for a significant chunk of time and he will be out for a couple of months I'd imagine."It gives someone else an opportunity and Richard de Carpentier brings a bit of energy - he's a bit more raw and not as big as Semisi, but he adds great physicality. Rav has not broken anything, which is key, but he has damaged his ankle joint and he'll be out for a few weeks."We've got James Percival to come back as well and that changes the nature of the side a bit too, but he won't be ready this weekend."On the plus side, Ryan's options have increased with the arrival of Argentina stars Agustin Creevy - a hooker - and Mariano Galarza, a lock.Galarza could play in the Amlin Challenge Cup this Saturday against Oyonnax.Ryan said: "Gus arrived today and Mariano arrived on Tuesday. We'll take Mariano to France with us and try to get him involved against Oyonnax. With Gus having just got off the plane, he probably won't be involved."
