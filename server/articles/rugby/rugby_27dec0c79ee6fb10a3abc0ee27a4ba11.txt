Sonny Bill Williams: Has been under pressure all seasonNew Zealand's Sonny Bill Williams has brushed asides concerns over the pressure he will be under during the World Cup, stating he has been under the microscope all season.Williams, who helped the All Blacks lift the Rugby Union World Cup in 2011, has not featured for the Kiwis in five years after switching codes in controversial circumstances.The 28-year-old made a spectacular return to the 13-man code with Sydney Roosters this year, helping them win the NRL premiership, and was a late inclusion in Stephen Kearney's tour party as he aims to become the first man to win the World Cup in both codes."There's nothing different," Williams told reporters. "From the start of this season, there was a lot of pressure. I had everything to lose and the pressure was firmly on me.

"I guess I kind of thrive on that. It gets the best out of me. I seem to be able to push that to one side and focus on all the little things."It starts with earning my team-mates' respect through doing the hard work that you don't see on TV, not the flashy stuff. I know once I do that, all the big plays, all the flashy things seem to come off."Williams, who dashed the hopes of Waikato Chiefs and the NZRU by signing a new contract with the Roosters for 2014, initially made himself unavailable for the World Cup and Kearney was forced to drop Melbourne forward Tohu Harris from his 24-man squad to make way for the ex-Toulon player after he underwent a change of heart.The former Canterbury Bulldog has once again expressed his regret over the way the situation was handled and insisted he has been made to feel welcome in the squad."There are regrets there but I've moved forward," he added. "I told (the) coach that I wouldn't come into the squad if the boys didn't want me but they wanted me to come into the squad and things are going well."It's awesome, I'm really excited and I just want to get out there, I wanted to play last week - I asked coach if I could play - but I guess a couple of weeks to get used to the game plan and things like that won't hurt. But I'm raring to go on Sunday if I get picked."Williams was rested for the Kiwis' friendly against the Cook Islands at Doncaster last Sunday but is expected to win his eighth cap in Sunday's opening World Cup game against Samoa at Warrington.Meanwhile, Williams has dispelled any lingering talk a move to the Salford Red Devils could be on the cards in future, stating he is likely to end his career in New Zealand."I'm pretty content with my home at the Roosters and, if I go back to play rugby (union), it will be with the Chiefs. I think I'll play out my future back home."
