Mike Phillips: Still part of Warren Gatland's plansWales coach Warren Gatland admits he will have "a quiet chat" with Mike Phillips in the wake of the scrum-half's latest alleged indiscretion, but insists he remains part of his plans.Phillips, along with team-mates Stephen Brett and Dwayne Haare, are alleged to have attended a video analysis session for Top 14 side Bayonne while under the influence of alcohol.The scrum-half was dropped for last Thursday's Amlin Challenge Cup defeat by Wasps at Adams Park but the club have refused to go into details over the incident."Having met on Tuesday the players Stephen Brett, Mike Phillips and Dwayne Haare, the board of the Aviron Bayonnais Rugby Pro do not intend to communicate on the recent facts such as reported by the press," read a brief statement."All the components of the club are turned to the next games to begin with the reception of Montpellier on Friday evening at the stadium Jean-Dauger."But Gatland has named Phillips in his squad for the autumn internationals with South Africa, Argentina, Tonga and Australia, insisting he has always acted responsibly when representing his country."All I can say is over the last campaigns with us he (Phillips) has been great," he said."He conducted himself extremely well with the Lions in Australia, both on and off the field."I am expecting that same sort of attitude from him when he is involved in this (autumn) campaign."Obviously, there are slight concerns about making sure that this is something that is not to be repeated."We will just sit down and have a quiet chat about where his head's at and what he's doing, but there will be no sanctions for him here in this set-up."Asked if any club sanction would affect his international prospects, Gatland added: "Not with us. That's a French decision. That is a Bayonne decision."
