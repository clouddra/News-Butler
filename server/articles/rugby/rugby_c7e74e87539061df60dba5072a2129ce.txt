Ryan Boyle: New deal for improving Castleford Tigers propRyan Boyle has signed a two-year contract extension with the Castleford Tigers.The 26-year-old made a big impression after a move from the Salford City Reds in April, a swap deal that saw Jake Emmitt head in the opposite direction.Prop Boyle started his career with Castleford as a junior before his move to the north west, and he is now tied to the club until the end of the 2016 season."As a Cas lad it means a lot to be playing for the club so I'm over the moon about signing a new deal," he said."I am enjoying rugby again which has contributed towards the improvement in my game and when Daryl Powell and Danny Orr came in they took my game to a new level. In the last third of the season I was probably playing the best rugby of my career so far."We are a really tight knit group of lads who all get along really well and I think we are all benefiting from the systems that Daryl and Danny have introduced."I know there's still room for improvement in some areas of my game so my main personal goal is to continue to improve and grow as a player under their guidance and to learn from them and my peers at the club."Coach Powell added: "Ryan was one of the from props in Super League at the end of last season so I'm absolutely delighted that he's agreed to extend his contract at Castleford for a further two years."I am sure that there is further improvement in him and I look forward to working with him in the coming seasons."
