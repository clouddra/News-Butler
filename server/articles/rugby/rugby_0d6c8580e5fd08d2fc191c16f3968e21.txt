    Scrum V has looked into the archives at new Cardiff Blues' defence coach Dale McIntosh's defensive qualities as a player.
    New Zealand-born McIntosh put in some notable tackles when Pontypridd beat Bath 19-6 at Sardis Road in the 1996-97 Heineken Cup.
    One 'hit' in particular made McIntosh a firm favourite among Pontypridd fans, flattening Bath's England and British and Irish Lions flanker Andy Robinson.
    We show some of the action from several angles.
