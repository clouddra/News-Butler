Sam Tomkins: Hard work ahead as England prepare to face AustraliaSam Tomkins is hoping Australia have been lulled into a false sense of security following England's shock defeat to Italy at the weekend.England lost their World Cup warm-up game 15-14 to the Italians at Salford with Kangaroos coach Tim Sheens watching on ahead of Saturday's World Cup opener at the Millennium Stadium.Full-back Tomkins admits the loss has piled the pressure on Steve McNamara's side as they look to bounce back against odds-on World Cup favourites Australia."They'll think they'll have an easy week won't they?" he said. "If that's how they're thinking, that's fine."They're the best in the world and we're under no illusions how tough next week will be. A massive amount needs fixing up."We're not daft. There are some smart blokes in there and we know we didn't perform as we planned to."We've put a bit more pressure on ourselves and we'll see how we go next week."England went into the game on the back of a two-week training camp in South Africa and Tomkins believes that build-up will stand them in good stead next weekend."We felt like we were ready for the game," he said. "We prepared well in South Africa and that will go a long way in this tournament because it's not just to get us a quick fix from one game. We will build into this."
