    Worcester hope a one-off price cut for next week's home game against Bath will bring back missing Warriors fans to inspire their misfiring team.
    Their 
    
12-match run without a win since 1 March  

    has led to this season's three home league games so far being played in a near half-empty stadium.
    "We're in a very difficult position," said chief executive Charles Cameron.
    "What the team need is as much encouragement as we can give to push them to that first win of the season."
     Sixways has a capacity of 12,024

    Worcester's occasional experiment of playing Premiership home matches on a Friday night has previously proved a winner at Sixways, creating a wonderful atmosphere when the team are winning.
    But this season's three Premiership home matches, only one of them played on a Friday, have been watched by an average crowd of 6,891, a long way below the stadium's 12,024 capacity. 
    And season ticket sales have fallen from a high of 5,985 for the 2008-09 season to 4,585 this term.
    "We're caught between a rock and a hard place. The atmosphere is flat," Cameron told BBC Hereford & Worcester. 
    "The start to the season has been very poor. A lot of fans have been disappointed with the performance.
    "We've consulted season ticket holders, debenture holders and fans and we thought, for a one-off match, why don't we try to recreate the atmosphere we've had in the past on Friday night and encourage fans to come down with the the price offer we have made."
    Before the Bath game, the winless Warriors return to Premiership action at Exeter on Saturday 
    
after two failures  in the Challenge Cup to chalk up a much-needed first victory for director of rugby Dean Ryan, against Oyonnax and Sale.
