     It was a great match between Leicester and Northampton (above, picture) on Sunday. Leicester produced an incredible fightback in the last 10 minutes while dealing with significant injury issues. Northampton, who to be fair were the better team for probably 60 minutes of the match, didn't manage to take the win. Who do you think can take more from the game though? 

 1979

    Hi 1979, winning is always best, whether it's against a weakened team or a full strength one. I think Saints will feel worst; the game was theirs for the taking at 19-9 up with 14 minutes to go. Tigers will think they got out of jail and will be feeling the better of the two sides.
