Dean Ryan: is impressed with the attitude of new signing Jeremy BecasseauWorcester Warriors have confirmed the signing of French prop Jeremy Becasseau from Stade Francais.The 21-year-old is the second player to make the switch from the French capital to Worcester following Paul Warwick's move earlier this summer.Becasseau featured in three Top 14 games for the French outfit last season as well as eight making eight appearances in the Amlin Challenge Cup, in which Stade Francais lost to Leinster in the final.The youngster is now keen to get started with the Warriors as he prepares for a new chapter in his career."I am very happy to join Worcester Warriors," he said. "It is a new challenge and I am looking forward to joining the team and starting training."It's a big move for me to come to the Aviva Premiership, but I am definitely excited about representing the Warriors."I was very happy when I came over to visit the club with the set-up, the structures in place and facilities. I now look forward to training hard and the start of the new season."Warriors director of rugby Dean Ryan declared his pleasure at the approach and drive the young Frenchman has shown."Jeremy is a driven and ambitious young man who is coming over from France to a new environment determined to make an impression," said Ryan."His path forward has been blocked at Stade Francais by a number of high profile signings and so he is taking this opportunity to really push himself. I like his attitude and the ambition he is showing, he is stepping out of his comfort zone because he wants to succeed."We were alerted to his potential and, in the context of the current injury we have to George Porter ahead of next season, we are pleased to have secured someone of his abilities at such short notice."
