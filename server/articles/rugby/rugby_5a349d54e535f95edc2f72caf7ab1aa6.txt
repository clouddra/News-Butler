Marland Yarde celebrates with London Irish boss Brian Smith after the win over HarlequinsMarland Yarde has revealed that a self-imposed alcohol ban has helped London Irish make an encouraging start to the Aviva Premiership season.The Exiles enforced the drinking ban in a bid to avoid a repeat of their dismal start to the last campaign, and Sunday's win over Harlequins was their second victory in five matches.They now face an Amlin Challenge Cup clash against Rugby Club I Cavalieri on Friday night, and their alcohol ban has been extended for another week."Staying off the drink was important and the guys really brought into it. You can see from the performances that the guys are playing really well," said England wing Yarde.
    "We know if we play to the best of our ability we can give any team in the league a really good run for the money and by not drinking we give ourselves the best chance of doing so."

"We know if we play to the best of our ability we can give any team in the league a really good run for the money and by not drinking we give ourselves the best chance of doing so."The ban's over now. It finished on the weekend but we didn't actually go out because we have a short turnaround before our game on Friday against a strong Italian team who will be coming to put down a marker."Yarde's form has enhanced his claims to start England's QBE Series against Australia, Argentina and New Zealand on the left wing, adding to the two caps he won in Argentina last summer."I will just try to be myself. I don't try to emulate anyone else, I just try to play to my strengths. Hopefully if I can do that I can play to a high standard," he said."I enjoy the big occasion, I enjoy playing in front of big crowds - it's part of the reason I play the sport. I get a real thrill from that."
