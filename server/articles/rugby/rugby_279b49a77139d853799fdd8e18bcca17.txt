MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin star linebacker Chris Borland doesn't plan to miss another game because of a hamstring injury.The 21st-ranked Badgers (6-2) play BYU on Saturday. Borland missed last week's 28-9 win at Iowa because of his sore hamstring.Coach Gary Andersen said Monday that he'll know for sure in the next day or so about the status of Borland and other injured Badgers.''We've made a lot of progress, some real positive progress in a number of those kids,'' Andersen said. ''But I can't say anybody's going to play for sure yet.''Borland is being a bit more definitive.''I've got confidence for this week,'' Borland said. ''I'd be shocked if I couldn't play.''He said he plans to return to practice Tuesday on at least a limited basis. Borland missed a couple days of practice last week after initially getting hurt early in the game against Illinois two weeks ago.Borland has a team-high 57 tackles and two sacks. Backup Marcus Trotter has played well in Borland's place with nine tackles each of the past two games.Top receiver Jared Abbrederis left last week's game with a chest injury suffered while catching a third-quarter touchdown. Defensive end Tyler Dippel is expected to miss a second straight game because of an unspecified family issue.Wisconsin will finish the season playing three of its last four at Camp Randall Stadium starting with Saturday's game against the Cougars.
