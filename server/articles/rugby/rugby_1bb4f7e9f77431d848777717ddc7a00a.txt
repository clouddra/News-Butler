Shaun Briscoe: Back with Hull KR as youth team assistant coachShaun Briscoe is returning to Hull KR after taking a role in the club's youth department.Briscoe brought an end to his playing days last month after two injury-hit seasons with the Widnes Vikings and he has been named as the club's Under-19s assistant coach and will also act as their partnership liaison officer.The 30-year-old spent four seasons with the Robins before leaving for Widnes and he is delighted to be back, intending to make the most of his experience to help the club's next generation."It's a brand-new experience for me," Briscoe told the Hull Daily Mail. "When I left Rovers to play for Widnes, I helped out coaching Thatto Heath Crusaders in the NCL Premier League."We've had a successful season and we can finish top of the table this weekend. It was a good challenge for me and I saw how much the players enjoyed their training."Coaching wasn't something I had set my mind to do, but coaching helped change my mind."The players play the game for the enjoyment and I enjoyed coaching. I really enjoyed my playing career and now I want to give something back."I'll pick bits from the coaches I've played under...and there have been a few. I learned lots under all of them and it would be foolish of me not to use that knowledge."It's a new experience for me and I will be learning a lot under Kev Deighton. When I was at Rovers before, I saw how passionate and committed he was to coaching the young players there. That passion hasn't dwindled and I'm looking forward to working with Kev."
