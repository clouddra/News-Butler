    England head coach Stuart Lancaster is likely to make "one or two" changes for Saturday's match against Argentina.
    England started their autumn campaign with a 
    
win over Australia, 

     but Lancaster is keen to assess a number of players as he aims to build a squad capable of winning the 2015 World Cup.
    "There might be one or two changes," he said. "A squad wins you a World Cup. 
    "Very few players play in all seven games. It is my job to build a squad and make sure I get the balance right." 
    Lancaster said he will make a final decision "over the next 24 to 48 hours", but Billy Twelvetrees looks set to retain his place despite missing a tackle that led to Matt Toomua's first-half try.
    "I'm still to decide. They haven't trained yet," Lancaster added. 
    "There is definitely scope to make changes. Luther Burrell and Kyle Eastmond are obvious inside centre options and Henry Trinder an outside centre option.
    "But Billy's done pretty well for us and deserves another chance I think."
    Alex Corbisiero could return against Argentina after recovering from his knee injury and may get the nod ahead of Mako Vunipola.
    Lock Geoff Parling has been given the all-clear from the concussion incurred in training last week and is available for selection.
