Manu Tuilagi: Likely to be out for two monthsEngland centre Manu Tuilagi will miss the autumn internationals because of injury.Tuilagi suffered a chest muscle injury late in the 31-6 Aviva Premiership victory over Newcastle on Saturday."Manu Tuilagi has a suspected torn pec muscle in his chest," said Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill. "He's having further investigation into that."Until we know exactly what the damage is it is hard to tell how long he will be out, but you'd think it is certainly weeks - potentially leading to months - rather than days."He did it in a tackle in the final minutes of the game on Saturday. Hopefully he has just partially torn a pec muscle - we're having it assessed. But it could mean surgery, depending on how severe it is."Tuilagi missed the first two weeks of the season whilst he recovered from a shoulder injury suffered on the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia.
