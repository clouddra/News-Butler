    England Rugby League coach Steve McNamara walks out of a news conference after a fractious encounter with journalists questioning his team selection.
    He refused to answer queries on why former captain James Graham has been left out of the 19-man squad 
    
to face Australia on Saturday.
    McNamara also refused to be drawn on whether the omission was linked to the drinking session that led to 
    
Gareth Hock being removed from the squad earlier this week.
