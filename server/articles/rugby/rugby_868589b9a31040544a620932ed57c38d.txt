Frank Winterstein: Tore his pectoral muscle last weekendSamoa have been refused permission to call up a replacement for forward Frank Winterstein, who has been ruled out of the rest of the World Cup due to injury.The former Widnes man, who will play for Bradford during the 2014 Super League season, was injured during the 42-24 loss to New Zealand last Sunday.He underwent surgery on Friday to re-attach his pectoral muscle, having torn it from the bone, and Samoa asked if they could summon a replacement.However, competition rules state that requested changes to the 24-man squads which are made after 21 October are at the discretion of tournament organisers and will only be granted in exceptional circumstances.And a statement said: "Samoa recently approached RLWC2013 to change two players in their squad. After due consideration, the request was denied."A spokesperson for Samoa said they had accepted the decision and will utilise a 23-man squad for the rest of the tournament.Their next match is against Papua New Guinea in Hull on Monday and they will be without skipper Harrison Hansen, who has a leg injury, and stand-off Reni Maitua, who picked up a knock against the Kiwis.Samoa coach Matt Parish has only been able to name an 18-man squad and St Helens second rower Sia Soliola will lead the side for the second time.
