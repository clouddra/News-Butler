    Twins George and Tom Burgess and older brother Sam are looking forward to representing England at the Rugby League World Cup.
    Head coach Steve McNamara named three of the four Australia-based 
    
Burgess brothers in his 24-man squad 

     which starts later this month.

All three brothers play for South Sydney Rabbitohs 

     in the NRL, as does fourth brother Luke, who missed out on selection.
