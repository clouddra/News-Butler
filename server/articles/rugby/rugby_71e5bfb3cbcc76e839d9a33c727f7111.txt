Stuart Lancaster has called up Henry Trinder, Joel Tomkins, Tom Johnson and Luther Burrell into the England squad for the Autumn Internationals.England boss Stuart Lancaster has handed Henry Trinder, Joel Tomkins and Luther Burrell call ups to the squad for the QBE internationals in November.With Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt out injured, midfield is Lancaster's main selection poser.And he has given himself plenty of options by calling up the uncapped trio of Gloucester's Trinder from the Saxons squad, Saracens' Tomkins - brother of Rugby League superstar Sam - and the man the coach has called the 'form centre' in the Aviva Premiership, Northampton's Burrell.Tomkins has been earmarked for international rugby since he switched codes. He missed the tour of Argentina in the summer because of injury, but his fine form for Saracens this season has given him a chance of a Test debut at the same time as his brother plays for England in the Rugby League World Cup.Burrell is in the squad as injury cover for Trinder, whilst his Northampton team-mate Alex Corbisiero is named in the squad but may not be able to play because of a knee injury.

As a coaching group we have watched a lot of rugby and we are pleased with the form of the squad. The camp is an important part of our preparation and we are looking forward to meeting up."Inevitably there have been some injuries and there is still a big European weekend ahead."But injures always create opportunities and we are pleased to call up Tom Johnson, Joel Tomkins, Henry Trinder and Luther Burrell into the Senior EPS, with Luther joining us as injury cover so it will be great for him to come in and put a marker down in what is going to be a competitive selection leading into the Australia game."We have three major Tests ahead of us and we are looking forward to the challenge."Lancaster is yet to announce who will captain the team, with Chris Robshaw and Tom Wood the leading candidates.Lancaster has yet to rule Northampton loosehead Corbisiero out against Australia after giving an open ended prognosis over his fitness."It's recommended that Alex has a couple of weeks' rehab. He's not out of the series by any stretch of the imagination," Lancaster said."Everyone is optimistically hoping he will come through and be available for some if not all the games."We have a really strong group at loosehead with Mako Vunipola and Joe Marler. We'll see how it goes with Alex."England play Australia, Argentina and New Zealand in successive weekends at Twickenham, starting with the Wallabies on 2 November.Forwards: David Attwood (Bath), Dan Cole, (Leicester), Alex Corbisiero (Northampton), Tom Johnson (Exeter), Dylan Hartley (Northampton), Matt Kvesic (Gloucester), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Ben Morgan (Gloucester), Geoff Parling (Leicester), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Billy Vunipola (Saracens), Mako Vunipola (Saracens), David Wilson (Bath), Tom Wood, (Northampton), Tom Youngs (Leicester)Backs: Chris Ashton (Saracens), Mike Brown (Harlequins), Freddie Burns (Gloucester), Luther Burrell, (Northampton), Danny Care (Harlequins), Lee Dickson (Northampton), Kyle Eastmond (Bath), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Toby Flood (Leicester), Ben Foden (Northampton), Alex Goode (Saracens), Henry Trinder (Gloucester), Joel Tomkins (Saracens), Billy Twelvetrees (Gloucester), Christian Wade (Wasps), Marland Yarde (London Irish), Ben Youngs (Leicester).
