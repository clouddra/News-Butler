(AP) -- A former Miami defensive lineman who tweeted that he would pay $1,000 to any Hurricane who ''takes ... out'' a Florida State player has lost his job as a sports radio host.Dan Sileo was fired Monday by WMEN, one day after posting the now-deleted tweet. Sileo says he only intended the tweet as a joke.The South Florida-based station says his actions ''have no place in sports.''Sileo has been criticized for on-air incidents in the past at other stations, including when he said last year he wanted Miami defenders to ''pull a knife'' on quarterbacks who run on them, and did not respond to a request for comment. He played for the Hurricanes in the mid-1980s and appeared in 10 NFL games with Tampa Bay in 1987.
