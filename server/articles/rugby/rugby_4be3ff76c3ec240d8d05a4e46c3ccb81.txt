He was injured in the Jets' loss at Tennessee in Week 4.Coach Rex Ryan says he was ''not optimistic today'' about Holmes' chances of playing since he didn't practice. Holmes said it could be a game-time decision.Limited at practice were: wide receivers Jeremy Kerley (hamstring) and Greg Salas (knee), safety Antonio Allen (groin, finger), center Nick Mangold (ribs) and tight ends Jeff Cumberland (hamstring) and Konrad Reuland (knee).---AP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org
