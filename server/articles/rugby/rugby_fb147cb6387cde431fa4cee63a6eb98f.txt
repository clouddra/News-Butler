    Uncapped Bath teenager Anthony Watson has been called into the England training squad ahead of Saturday's Test against Argentina at Twickenham. 
    The 19-year-old full-back was part of the England Under-20 team 
    
which won the Junior World Cup in the summer.
    England coach Stuart Lancaster said: "We are bringing Anthony into camp to take a look at him. 
    "He is playing well for Bath so this is a good opportunity to give him a taste of this environment."
    Lancaster added: "We want to take a look at him in the same way that we have done in the past with others outside the senior or Saxons squads, such as [current England second row] Joe Launchbury." 
    Watson, 
    
who joined Bath from London Irish 

     during the summer, has been involved with the England junior set-up since Under-16s level, and was promoted to the Under-20s side when still only 17.
    Shortlisted for the 2011 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year, Watson played in all of England's Under-20s Six Nations games the following year and scored four tries, including one in a 20-9 win over Ireland at Adams Park that clinched the title.
    Watson also touched down in a 33-21 win over New Zealand in this summer's 2013 IRB Junior World Championship semi-final before featuring in the win over Wales in the final.
