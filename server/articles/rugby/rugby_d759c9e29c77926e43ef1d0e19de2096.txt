Rob Cook: New two-year deal for Gloucester full-backGloucester have secured the future of full-back Rob Cook on a new two-year contract.The 29-year-old has become a regular in the No 15 shirt since his move from the Cornish Pirates last season, scoring four tries and proving consistent in defence as well as attack."I'm thrilled to have the chance to extend my stay at such a great club and continue my rugby development," Cook said. "I've played in some great games in my Gloucester career to date, and I want to be part of many more."My time at the club has been amazing so far, and the boys around me have helped me to develop my game and push myself to make the step up from Championship to Premiership and European rugby."The fans have also been outstanding. To have the chance to run out to that Kingsholm roar and experience that matchday atmosphere is brilliant for me, and something I can't wait to experience more of."Director of Rugby Nigel Davies added: "Rob's been fabulous. He came up from the Pirates, playing in the Championship, and he's really taken to the Premiership."He's evolved his game, he's developed his conditioning and he brings that little bit of experience to what is, in essence, a very young backline. He manages and controls things from the back there."He makes very few errors, tends to put the team in the right places and takes pressure off the team at the right times as well."
