Stuart Lancaster: Not getting over-excited after victoryEngland head coach Stuart Lancaster says their victory over Australia will be tarnished if they do not continue the good work in their upcoming matches.Lancaster's men came from behind to beat the Wallabies 20-13 on Saturday and they now have to face Argentina next weekend, before a clash with the mighty All Blacks.Asked if he had felt under pressure to beat Australia, Lancaster said: "I always feel the pressure of winning as England head coach, there's no doubt about that."We've won eight out of our last nine games now, but I felt it here because I know it builds some momentum and allows the team some space to grow."But it means nothing if we don't turn up and perform and win next weekend. It's a good start, but we're not getting carried away."And Lancaster has hinted that he may make changes in the midfield after centres Billy Twelvetrees and Joel Tomkins were a little disappointing on Saturday.Regular centres Brad Barritt and Manu Tuilagi are injured but Luther Burrell and Kyle Eastmond give Lancaster options at the position.And the coach said: "I'll be looking at the whole side in terms of selection. You have to build and win the next game."Both Kyle and Luther are genuine options. Luther on form, certainly."Prop Alex Corbisiero and second row Geoff Parling are expected to be available to face Argentina after missing the game against Australia due to injury.
