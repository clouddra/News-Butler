Sam Warburton: Waiting on Blues offerBritish and Irish Lions skipper Sam Warburton is waiting for a contract offer from club side Cardiff Blues after confirming he wants to stay with them.Warburton is one of the hottest properties in European rugby and he has been linked with a move to French sides Clermont, Toulon and Racing Metro.The 25-year-old's contract expires at the end of the season and he is keen to remain with Blues, but must wait for the RaboDirect Pro12 side to decide if they can afford to retain his services."I've told Cardiff and the WRU that I want to extend (my contract) and sign here," Warburton told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek."I'm awaiting an offer. I haven't received anything yet, but that's my preferred option at this moment in time."The Welsh Rugby Union has considered the possibility of centrally contracting their star players, such as Warburton and full-back Leigh Halfpenny, to keep them at home.But Warburton is growing tired of the ongoing dispute over the future of European club rugby, a factor which is delaying Cardiff's decision on whether they can afford to offer him a new contract."It's going around in circles and nothing seems to be getting resolved," he added."It's got to the stage now where I don't want to know anything about the European situation until it's resolved."Without sounding disrespectful, it's almost bored me. I don't know what's going and don't have any control over what happens."It's a waiting game and as soon as anything happens I'll be keen to know, but until then I'll just forget about it."
