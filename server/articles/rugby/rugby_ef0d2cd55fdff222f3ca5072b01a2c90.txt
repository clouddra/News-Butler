Vern Cotter: Still Clermont coach as far as he understandsVern Cotter has denied reports that he offered to quit as coach of Clermont to take over his role with Scotland 12 months ahead of schedule.New Zealander Cotter was confirmed as the permanent replacement for Andy Robinson on Tuesday, but he will not start working in the role until June next year when his contract in France expires.After Cotter criticised some of his players in the media, Clermont president Rene Fontes gave an interview claiming that Cotter had tendered his resignation and said their board would meet to discuss it.But Cotter said: "No, I haven't resigned. This is unclear. I would like a little bit of clarity and I will be ringing my president to see what the situation is."Apparently there has been a reaction to an article I gave stating my honest appraisal of how the club should move forward."I'm surprised because we had agreed to move forward to 2014, so I will obviously be asking a few questions."We have had discussions with Mark Dodson and the Scotland management team early on and the club asked me to stay for another year."I don't know if that position has changed but that will be part of the phone call that I make. The most important thing is to make sure whatever decision is made is done properly."
