EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph will miss at least the next month with a fractured left foot.Vikings coach Leslie Frazier gave the update Monday, one day after Rudolph was injured in a 27-23 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Rudolph could miss as many as six weeks while recovering, a tough blow to the Vikings offense. He is one of quarterback Christian Ponder's favorite targets.Rudolph was injured in the third quarter on a 31-yard touchdown reception. He has 30 catches for 313 yards and three touchdowns this season.The injury likely means more time for backup tight end John Carlson, a big-money free agent signing two years ago that hasn't panned out. Carlson has 19 catches for 104 yards in 22 games for the Vikings.
