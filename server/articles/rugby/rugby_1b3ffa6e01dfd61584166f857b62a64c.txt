Matthew Rees: Requires testicular surgeryCardiff Blues and Wales international hooker Matthew Rees is to undergo testicular surgery and will have "an enforced spell away from rugby".Former Wales skipper Rees has won 58 caps and played in the 2009 British and Irish Lions Test series against South Africa.The 32-year-old is the current Blues captain and has made six appearances, his last in the 44-29 Heineken Cup defeat in Exeter, for his new region since switching from Scarlets in the summer.The Blues said: "Cardiff Blues have today announced that club captain Matthew Rees is to have an enforced spell away from rugby."Cardiff Blues would like to take this opportunity to wish Matthew a speedy recovery, and we look forward to seeing him back in action in the future."The region will be making no further comment and would ask that the media respect Matthew's privacy at this time."Rees was expected to be named in the Wales squad for next month's Tests against South Africa, Argentina, Tonga and Australia.He replaced an injured Ryan Jones as Wales captain against Australia in November 2010, and he skippered his country during the RBS Six Nations Championship later that season.He missed the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand, though, due to a neck injury and his current Blues colleague Sam Warburton took over as national captain.Although Richard Hibbard is the current first-choice Wales hooker, Rees had remained an important part of the squad under head coach Warren Gatland.Rees began his career with Welsh club side Pontypridd before joining the Celtic Warriors until they were dissolved. He then went on to make more than 170 appearances for the Scarlets.
