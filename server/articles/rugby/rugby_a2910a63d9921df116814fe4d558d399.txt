Leigh Halfpenny: No bid from Racing Metro for the Cardiff Blues starRacing Metro have denied reports they are set to make a bid for Wales and British and Irish Lions star Leigh Halfpenny.Halfpenny has become one of the most sought-after players in Europe following his magnificent displays for Wales and the Lions this year.The full-back was player of the series on the recent Lions tour of Australia, and his club Cardiff Blues admit they cannot compete financially with the riches on offer in France - despite receiving financial help from the Welsh Rugby Union - if Halfpenny chooses to cash in on his new-found status.Reports in the rugby press claimed the hugely wealthy Paris-based club Racing - who have already signed Lions trio Jonny Sexton, Jamie Roberts and Dan Lydiate this summer - wanted to secure the services of Halfpenny.But in a statement the Top 14 side said: "Racing Metro 92, through its president Jacky Lorenzetti, wishes to deny this information. The club is not one of the proposed bidding agents."
