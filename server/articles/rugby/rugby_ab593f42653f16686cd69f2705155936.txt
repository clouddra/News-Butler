Scotland's Under-20s captain will now team up with his brother in Scott Johnson's 41-strong group and the teenager is excited at the prospect of stepping up to the international scene."Playing for Scotland is all you think about when you are younger and hopefully that will come and hopefully I will follow in his footsteps," said Gray."People have said to me it will maybe be you and your brother one day and you laugh it off and say 'maybe' but you never think it will be true."Obviously I am delighted but I know I have a lot of work before I get there. He has always been a role model. When you look at what he has achieved in his career so far, it is what any player wants to do."This is an opportunity to train with him. I have not seen him for a while with him being in France and being with the Lions. So it will be good to be with him and I am really excited about it."
