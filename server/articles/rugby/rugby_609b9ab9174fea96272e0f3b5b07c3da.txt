After a couple of defeats earlier in the season the 49ers have put together four straight wins to keep hot on the heels of NFC West leaders Seattle, and they would love to go into their bye week having made it five."They're a good defence," Kaepernick said of the Jaguars. "They have a lot of good players over there - they're going to play hard, they're going to play fast so we're going to have to be ready for them."Kaepernick started the season superbly against Green Bay showing no signs of a lingering Super Bowl hangover, but two following losses got them back on track.They will have to keep on winning and try and beat Seattle in their divisional re-match to stand a chance of winning the NFC West, but Kaepernick says he has a huge desire after coming so close last year.The quarterback came out of nowhere to get the start after Alex Smith was injured and led the team to the Super Bowl, but coming so close has only intensified his desire to lift the Vince Lombardi Trophy."Last season, it was amazing, it was exciting but we didn't finish the way we wanted to so this off-season it was tough I thought about it a lot," he added."I thought about it a lot in training and coming into this season it's something that's helped motivate me."
