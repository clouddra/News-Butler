James Horwill: Everything clicked into placeJames Horwill was a satisfied Australian skipper after the Wallabies ended their Rugby Championship campaign with a crushing 54-17 victory over Argentina in Rosario on Saturday.The visitors ran in seven tries, to two from their opponents, with the lock forward saying: "At times you need games like that when things come good."We're very proud of how the group went about their work, it's very pleasing to get a result like that."It's a real confidence booster for us. We're very, very happy with the result."Sometimes you get the bounce of the ball and things come off and one-to-15 we really put in the effort."We're really pleased to get the result, especially over here in Rosario."

Aussie coach Ewen McKenzie added: "We had great playing conditions. We lost the toss for the sixth game in a row so we were staring down the barrel but we really played with purpose and showed some toughness at key moments."We trained differently during the week and spent time talking about how we wanted to play. The mindset was good and that was transferred to the pitch."But there was disappointment for home captain Juan Fernandez Lobbe: "They played a great match, great rugby, they were able to display the game they hadn't managed in the previous matches in the tournament."They pounced on our loss of possession and failures in defence and then it becomes difficult to chase the score the whole match."We are disappointed but we have to congratulate Australia for the way they played."They came here with their backs against the wall and played great rugby. We missed too many tackles."And Felipe Contepomi, who was playing his final international match of a career that yielded 87 caps and 651 points, said: "I'm fortunate for all I've experienced in rugby."We failed again, making individual errors. You're playing against the three best teams in the world. Just when you think you're getting close they pull away. We have to keep working."
