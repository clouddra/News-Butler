    Leeds Rhinos have terminated the contract of prop Richard Moore by mutual consent.
    Moore, 31, who still had one year remaining on his deal, started his career in the club's academy and 
    
re-joined them from Crusaders in 2012.
    Coach Brian McDermott said: "He has been a great servant to Leeds over the last two seasons and always prepared to help out the team wherever possible."
    "We appreciate his desire to secure more game time and wish him well."
