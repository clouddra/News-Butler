Jonny Sexton: On club duty with Racing Metro this weekendIreland fly-half Jonny Sexton has returned to Racing Metro ahead of this weekend's Top 14 game against Biarritz.Ireland coach Joe Schmidt is hoping Racing will rest the 28-year-old for the trip  to the French league's bottom side as he feels Sexton is showing signs of fatigue after a busy start to the season."Hopefully he'll get the weekend off, be it in Ireland or France," said Schmidt."He just was pretty tired at the start of the week. He was a little flat. I know Jonny pretty well and he's a pretty buoyant character, a bossy character in a really good sense."He was definitely a bit flat. He's bouncing back now, but he's also taking a flight to Paris."If he is run down next week or if he does play against Biarritz then it's a great opportunity for Paddy (Jackson) or Ian (Madigan) to step up and make a mark (against Samoa)."Schmidt will wait until next week before announcing a captain for Ireland's autumn series, as doubts remain over the availability of key players such as Paul O'Connell, Brian O'Driscoll and Sean O'Brien.Ireland face Samoa at the Aviva Stadium on 9 November, with Australia and New Zealand visiting Dublin on 16 and 24 November respectively.Meanwhile, five players have been released from Ireland's training camp to their respective provinces for this weekend's Pro12 matches.Ulster duo Andrew Trimble and Roger Wilson, Munster's Donncha O'Callaghan and James Coughlan, and Leinster prop Martin Moore are all available for selection for the round seven fixtures.
