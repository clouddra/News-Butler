Joe Schmidt: Has named his first Ireland training squadIreland coach Joe Schmidt has named his first training squad ahead of the autumn internationals.The most notable omission was Tom Court, the Ulster prop who was called into the British & Irish Lions squad this summer.Tommy O'Donnell, Michael Bent, Stuart Olding, Andrew Trimble, Craig Gilroy and Felix Jones were not considered because of injury.Schmidt said: "Selection was difficult as it's the first time we have had to narrow our focus a bit and determine a cut off point for players. A number of selections were very tight which is positive."The group is predominantly 'tried and proven' but with some newer faces as well. It's an opportunity to get to know the players as well as an opportunity to have a look ahead and start to get a little bit of organization done for the Guinness Series."There are also a few players who have not yet had many opportunities to make an impression and a few youngsters who have been impressive in the early rounds of the Pro 12 that we've left to keep working with their provinces."There is no doubting the challenge that autumn presents but we're looking forward to get a little bit of a head start this weekend".Ireland training squad: Stephen Archer, Rory Best,  Isaac Boss, Tommy Bowe, James Coughlan, Sean Cronin, Gordon D'Arcy, Keith Earls, Luke Fitzgerald, Declan Fitzpatrick, Cian Healy, Jamie Heaslip, Iain Henderson, Chris Henry, Robbie Henshaw, Paddy Jackson, Shane Jennings, Rob Kearney, Dave Kearney, David Kilcoyne, Ian Madigan, Luke Marshall, Mike McCarthy, Fergus McFadden, Jack McGrath, Kevin McLaughlin, Niall Morris, Conor Murray, Sean O'Brien, Donncha O'Callaghan, Paul O'Connell, Brian O'Driscoll, Peter O'Mahony, Eoin Reddan, Mike Ross, Donnacha Ryan, Jonathan Sexton, Mike Sherry, Richardt Strauss, Devin Toner, Dan Tuohy, Simon Zebo.
