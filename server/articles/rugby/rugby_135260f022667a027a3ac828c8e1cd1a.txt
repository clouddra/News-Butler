    A late try by replacement Gareth Davies gave Cardiff Blues a dramatic win over Heineken Cup holders Toulon at the Arms Park.
    Rhys Patchell and Leigh Halfpenny's first-half kicking duel with Jonny Wilkinson ended level at 6-6.
    Wilkinson kicked three more penalties after the break with Halfpenny twice responding for the hosts.
    But Davies broke free from a tackle to score two minutes from the end and Halfpenny converted.
    Having conceded 
    
five first-half tries in defeat at Exeter Chiefs 

     in their opening game, director of rugby Phil Davies had demanded a telling response from his players.
    The hosts earned a bonus point for their four-tries second-half effort at Exeter and Davies hoped they would maintain that momentum against the wealthy French club.
    But few could have expected the Blues to give Phil Davies such a memorable 50th birthday present as they toppled the star-studded French Top 14 team.
    The Blues also had to contend with a late change when skipper and hooker Matthew Rees was ruled out by illness and Wales and Lions wing Alex Cuthbert failing to come out for the second period after suffering a leg injury.
    Marc Breeze came into the starting line-up while ex-Toulon prop Gethin Jenkins took over the captaincy.
    The visitors found the Blues' defence as impenetrable as it had been porous at Sandy Park in the opening round.
    In midweek the Welsh region parted company with defence coach Rob Powell and 
    
announced Pontypridd head coach Dale McIntosh as his replacement.
    McIntosh - 
    
known affectionately as The Chief 

     - was at Sardis Road to end 24 years of playing and coaching as they took on London Welsh in the British and Irish Cup.
    But he will have been heartened to learn of the Blues' defensive effort, particularly in the dying moments as Toulon tried and failed to hit back.
