Coverage: Live on BBC 2, Radio Wales, Radio Cymru and Online    South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer is viewing the clash against Wales on Saturday at the Millennium Stadium as a "huge challenge" for his players.
    Meyer says he is treating the Welsh with the utmost respect on the opening game of the Springboks' tour.

“This is a totally different game than the Rugby Championship. It's more of an arm-wrestle”
    "Wales are an unbelievable team, they have shown they can beat the best," insisted Meyer. 
    "They are a very balanced side, big backs, big forwards, great rushing defence and they can score tries."
    The South African added: "We see this as a very big game for us, a huge challenge.
    "They have been together for a while now and have a simple game-plan but they execute it very well. "
    And Meyer does not expect the Springboks to be allowed to dictate terms and be able to play an expansive brand of rugby which saw them score the most points of any team in the Rugby Championship.
    South Africa scored 23 tries in six games finishing second behind New Zealand but well ahead of Australia and Argentina. 
    "This is a totally different game than the Rugby Championship. It's more of an arm-wrestle," said Meyer. 
    "We have to change the way we play, we have to be more clinical and execute better." 
    Meyer has told his players that the tour will be viewed as an audition for the 2015 World Cup in England.
