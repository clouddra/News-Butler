Diccon Edwards: Has resigned as Leeds bossLeeds Carnegie head coach Diccon Edwards has left the RFU Championship club despite guiding them to the play-off semi-finals.Leeds only missed out on a place in the final by four points, having beaten Newcastle in the first leg before being edged out by the eventual champions at Kingston Park.However Edwards, who returned to the club where he had been a player and academy manager in 2011 following Carnegie's relegation from the Premiership, has now opted to leave.Edwards, who had a year left to run on his current deal, said: "I wish the club all the best for the future."I am proud of the fact that the club is now in a stronger position than when I arrived two seasons ago and I am sure the players will continue to build on the progress we have made."Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington claimed there were no immediate plans to appoint a successor to the 40-year-old.He added: "We will take our time to make sure we make the right appointment to take us forward."The players reported back for pre-season training this week and the majority of their time in the next few weeks will be with the conditioning staff so there is no pressure to rush into an appointment."
