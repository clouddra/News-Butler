Heyneke Meyer: Expecting different brand of rugby in EuropeSouth Africa coach Heyneke Meyer has warned his team to expect "arm-wrestle" rugby on their European tour.The Springboks scored 23 tries in their six Rugby Championship matches, scoring more points than even champions New Zealand.But Meyer believes his players will find it much harder to score points in their matches with Wales, Scotland and France."This is a totally different game than the Rugby Championship, it's more of an arm-wrestle," Meyer said."We have to change the way we play, we have to be more clinical and execute better."Meyer has told his players that this tour, more than the Rugby Championship, will be an audition for the World Cup to be hosted by England in 2015, and that those who do not prove their ability to adapt to northern hemisphere conditions face the axe."In our last end of season tour we learnt a lot about our players. A lot of players from that tour aren't here anymore," Meyer said."It's very important to have the World Cup in the back of your mind, to see which players can play at this level against three tough teams and in these difficult conditions."By the end of this tour we should be close to knowing 25 of the 30 players who will go to the World Cup."In these conditions you are not going to have as many opportunities so you have to convert those into points."Against New Zealand (at Ellis Park on October 5) we had 17 line-breaks and scored just four tries, they had seven line-breaks and scored five tries. That's not good enough, we get a lot of opportunities and don't use them."Our scrumming was awesome in the Rugby Championship, we gave the least amount of restarts and the least amount of collapsed scrums."I think we have really improved at the breakdown, but here in the northern hemisphere it is more 50-50 on the ground."Our lineouts have been close to 100 percent, though I'm not happy with our kick-offs. We give away too many turn overs, we need to look after the ball better. Here [in the northern hemisphere] you need to be patient and wait for your opportunities to convert pressure into points."Wales are an unbelievable team, they have shown they can beat the best. They have been together for a while now and have a simple game-plan but they execute it very well."
