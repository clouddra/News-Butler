Toby Flood anticipates a tough European opener for Leicester at RavenhillToby Flood admits Leicester face a tricky start to their Heineken Cup campaign this weekend but believes the Tigers are certainly no European pushovers.The Welford Road club last won Europe's premier club competition 11 years ago and on Friday travel to Belfast to take on Ulster in their Pool 5 opener.Both previous visits have produced defeats for Leicester - 33-0 in 2003, and 41-7 nine years later.And fly-half Flood is ready for another tough battle: "We've had two very bad nights at Ravenhill down the years."I didn't go to Belfast two seasons ago but it was very disappointing."They played very well and we were poor. We can't afford for that to happen again."There is certainly a burning desire within the squad to reach the final again."It has been a frustrating 11 years waiting to bring the Heineken Cup back to Welford Road."Last year we had to go to Toulon in the quarter-finals but we all felt we could have come away with a result there."We are a club that is capable of winning on the road in the big games."Games in this tournament don't come much harder than having to face Ulster at Ravenhill on a Friday night."It is as hard a place to go as any in Europe but no team can afford to take Leicester lightly."Watch Ulster v Leicester live on Sky Sports 1 this Friday from 7pm
