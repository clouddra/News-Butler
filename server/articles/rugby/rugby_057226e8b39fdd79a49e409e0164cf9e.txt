Tommaso Allan: First call up into Italy squadTommaso Allan has been called into the Italy squad for the first time, ending Scotland's chances of picking him.Allan, 20, plays for Perpignan in the Top 14, and has previously represented Scotland U17, U18 and U20.His father William Allan and mother Paola Berlato both played in Italy and his uncle John Allan earned nine Scotland caps as well as a number of caps for South Africa.Tommaso, who can play at fly-half, in midfield or at full-back, was born in Vicenza and came through Wasps' youth programme, and has been included in the Italy squad for November Tests against Australia, Fiji and Argentina.Brunel has also called up two other rookies in Ruggero Trevisan of Zebre, and centre Michele Campagnaro of Treviso for the training camps to be held at the end of the month.Although Trevisan was part of Italy's tour of South Africa, neither he, Campagnaro nor Allan have played for Italy.Brunel will name his final 30-man squad on November 3.
