    A commanding second-half performance from Glasgow Warriors cemented their first win of Pool 2 in the Heineken Cup.
    Gregor Townsend's men had been fortunate to only trail by three points at the break as Exeter Chiefs took the game to their hosts.
    However, they dominated the second half and Tim Swinson and Tyrone Holmes both went over to give them a 20-9 lead.
    Dave Ewers' converted try made it a nervy finish, but the Warriors held on.
    The result moves Glasgow back into contention in the group, while Exeter's late try ensures they take away a bonus point.
    The home side were behind after just three minutes when Al Kellock conceded a penalty, and Gareth Steenson put the ball through the posts.
    In a hectic start Ruaridh Jackson had Glasgow back level inside 10 minutes after an exhausting four minutes of attacking play. 
    Exeter were having the better of the first half, but after both sides continued to exchange penalties the visitors had a mere three-point lead after 25 minutes.
    Steenson then saw yellow, but it appeared the referee had missed Gabriel Ascarate's knock-on.
