Brad Barritt: ruled out until ChristmasEngland centre Brad Barritt will miss the autumn internationals after undergoing foot surgery.Barritt started Saracens' 42-20 Aviva Premiership victory over London Irish at Twickenham last weekend, but was omitted from the matchday 22 for Sunday's clash with Gloucester.The 27-year-old, who was called up to the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia during the summer, has had corrective surgery on damaged ligaments in his foot and is expected to return by Christmas.Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall hinted an extended spell out might prove beneficial for the South African-born back."We're not exactly sure of the time frame. It's really unfortunate for Brad because he's been outstanding for us over the last four seasons," McCall said."We'll miss him for the next three months or so, but Brad hasn't had much of a break from rugby for four and a half years."Getting him back in January will be a real bonus for us and he'll have a lot to look forward to from that moment on."We're not exactly sure when the injury happened. He injured that foot against Toulon last season and it's come back again. It's unfortunate, it's one of those things."England face Australia, Argentina and New Zealand this November and the loss of Barritt will be a blow to head coach Stuart Lancaster.In his absence Gloucester's Billy Twelvetrees and Bath's Kyle Eastmond are likely to compete for the No 12 shirt for England this autumn.Barritt is the second player to be ruled out of England's autumn schedule in five days after flanker Tom Croft underwent season-ending knee surgery last week.You can watch England's autumn internationals live on Sky Sports.
