Daniel Hourcade: Unveils first squad as Argentina coachDaniel Hourcade has named his first squad since he replaced Santiago Phelan as Argentina coach for next month's three-Test tour of Europe.Hourcade, 55, who stepped up to the job after years of coaching the junior Argentine sides when Phelan resigned last Monday, named a 31-man squad for the Tests with England, Wales and Italy.No fewer than nine of the squad play in the Aviva Premiership.The Pumas have lost eight of their nine Tests this year, although they put up some respectable performances in the Four Nations tournament with southern hemisphere heavyweights the All Blacks, Springboks and Australia.Hourcade - who never coached at the top level in Europe though he was assistant coach to the Portugal side that played in the 2007 World Cup - did not nominate a captain to replace Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe, who broke his elbow while playing for European champions Toulon last Saturday.Toulouse forward Patricio Albacete is the most likely candidate to fill that role.Among those called up by Hourcade are two players who recently signed contracts with Super 15 sides, prop Matias Diaz and lock Manuel Carizza. They joined New Zealand outfit Otago Highlanders and South African side Western Province respectively.The Pumas - World Cup semi-finalists in 2007 and quarter-finalists in 2011 - begin their Test programme against England at Twickenham on November 9.They then face Wales in Cardiff a week later and round off their tour against Italy in Rome on November 23.SquadForwards: Patricio Albacete (Toulouse), Gabriel Ascarate (Glasgow Warriors), Marcos Ayerza (Leicester), Manuel Carizza (Western Province), Horacio Agulla (Bath), Agustin Creevy (Worcester), Matias Daâ‚¬az (Otago), Julio Cabello (Tucuman), Mariano Galarza (Worcester), Eusebio Guinazu (Bath), Santiago Iglesias (Universitario de Tucuman), Juan Manuel Leguizamon (Lyon), Nahuel Lobo (no club), Benjamin Macome (Tucuman), Pablo Matera (Leicester), Juan Pablo Orlandi (Bath), Leonardo Senatore (Worcester)Backs: Marcelo Bosch (Saracens), Maximiliano Bustos (Montpellier), Santiago Cordero (Regatas de Bella Vista), Tomas Cubelli (Belgrano Athletic), Santiago Fernandez (Bayonne), Lucas Gonzalez Amorosino (Oyonnax), Juan Imhoff (Racing Metro), Juan Martin Hernandez (Racing Metro), Martin Landajo (CA San Isidro), Tomas Lavanini (Hindu Club), Javier Rojas (Universitario de Tucuman), Nicolas Sanchez (Bordeaux-Begles), Gonzalo Tiesi (no club), Joaquin Tuculet (Bordeaux-Begles)
