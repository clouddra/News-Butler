I think this move is coming at the perfect time for me to learn from the best and keep progressing my footie."I hope to bring a different rugby perspective because of my different pathway into professional rugby. I'll definitely bring a lot of energy and heaps of passion."Unfortunately my grandparents have passed away now, but I know they'd both be very proud to see one of the grandsons living in Scotland and playing for one of the top club sides."
