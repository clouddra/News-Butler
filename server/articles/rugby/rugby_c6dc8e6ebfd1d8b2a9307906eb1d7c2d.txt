Christian Leali'ifano has been ruled out of Saturday's Bledisloe Cup match against New Zealand in DunedinAustralia must find a replacement goalkicker after Christian Leali'ifano was ruled out of this Saturday's Bledisloe Cup Test against New Zealand.Australia's coach Ewen McKenzie has ruled the inside centre out of the match because of a compression injury to his right ankle.Lealiifano suffered the injury during their final Rugby Championship game against Argentina.McKenzie reported that the injury was on the same ankle Lealiifano broke last year.Matt Toomua is expected to replace Lealiifano for the fixture at Dunedin's indoor stadium while fly-half Quade Cooper may take over kicking duties.McKenzie said: "Lealiifano's ankle has been an ongoing problem for some time."The short-term plan is to rest him and get him back as close to 100 per-cent as possible, as opposed to pushing him through now and then he'd have to play six games in a row at 80 per-cent."That's not fair on him or the team."Scott Fardy has also been ruled out of the match with bleeding behind an eye, with his spot expected to go to Ben McCalman.
