    Leeds Rhinos centre Jimmy Keinhorst has agreed a new three-year deal with the Super League side.
    The 23-year-old Germany international made nine league appearances last season, scoring three tries.
    Head coach Brian McDermott said: "We are delighted that Jimmy has agreed the new deal and I look forward to seeing him develop even further. 
    "Securing Jimmy adds to the strength in our squad and that will be important next season."
