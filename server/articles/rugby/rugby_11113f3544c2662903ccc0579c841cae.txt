ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- The Denver Broncos have activated All-Pro linebacker Von Miller following his six-game drug suspension.To make room, the Broncos waived wide receiver Tavarres King, whom they'd promoted from their practice squad earlier in the week to keep him from joining the Green Bay Packers.The speedy King was a fifth-round draft pick from Georgia. He had vowed to make the most of his promotion, saying he'd learned his lessons after failing to make the final cut in camp.Miller returned to practice Wednesday after serving his ban for violating the league's drug-abuse policy.Miller has 30 sacks in his first two seasons and guaranteed a Super Bowl victory in the offseason. He makes his debut Sunday night when the Broncos (6-0) visit the Colts (4-2).---AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org
