Rob Gronkowski: Yet to take the field for the Patriots this seasonRob Gronkowski is expected to make his first appearance of the season this Sunday when New England take on the New York Jets.The Patriots tight end has sat out the first six games of the campaign following multiple operations on the forearm he fractured twice last season.He underwent a fourth surgery in May to cure an infection in the arm, while he also had a minor back procedure in June.But the 24-year-old returned to full training last week, and his agent has confirmed that Gronkowski has been cleared to feature against their AFC East rivals this weekend."Rob Gronkowski has now been cleared by all his doctors to play Sunday in the Jets game," agent Drew Rosenhaus said in a statement.Patriots head coach Bill Belichick did not confirm the news at his pre-game press conference on Friday, merely stating that Gronkowski would be listed on the injury report.New England currently top the AFC East with a 5-1 record after Tom Brady's last-gasp 17-yard touchdown pass to Kenbrell Thompkins earned a thrilling 30-27 victory over New Orleans last week.Sunday's NFL coverage starts with the Cincinnati Bengals taking on Detroit, live on Sky Sports 2 from 5.30pm
