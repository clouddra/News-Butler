Russell Wilson: Threw three TD passes for Seahawks on Thursday nightRussell Wilson threw three touchdown passes as the Seattle Seahawks continued their fine start to the season with a 34-22 win over the Arizona Cardinals.The victory took the Seahawks to 6-1, the best start in franchise history, and came courtesy of some fine play on both sides of the ball.Their defence came up with some big plays at the right time, intercepting Carson Palmer twice at critical moments and sacking him seven times.Palmer's first pick in the first quarter led to the opening score when Wilson combined with Sidney Rice for a 31-yard touchdown, and the Seahawks moved 14-0 ahead when Zach Miller caught a 15-yard Wilson pass.The Cardinals rallied with a Jay Feely field goal and a three-yard scamper from Rashard Mendenhall, but a Steven Hauschka 51-yarder five seconds before half-time made it 17-10 to Seattle at the interval.But it was a five minute spell in the third quarter that proved key for Seattle as Wilson hit Kellen Davis in the endzone from a yard and Marshawn Lynch powered over from two yards on a night he rushed for 91 yards.Leading by 18, the Seahawks switched off a little in the closing minutes and allowed a Palmer pass to Jaron Brown to cut the deficit, but they had little trouble holding on for the victory."We got off to a great start and scored some great touchdowns in the first 15, it doesn't get much better than that," Wilson said."I thought the offensive line did a very good job tonight and the defence was great going up against a very good football team."
