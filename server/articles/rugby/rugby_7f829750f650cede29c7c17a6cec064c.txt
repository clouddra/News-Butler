Jarius Wynn: Has joined the Dallas CowboysThe Dallas Cowboys have moved to cover the loss of the injured DeMarcus Ware by signing defensive end Jarius Wynn.Ware is poised to miss the first game of his eight-year career at Philadelphia on Sunday after suffering a right quadriceps injury against Washington.Wynn was a free agent following his release by the San Diego Chargers last week.Wynn was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in 2009 and was part of the squad that won Super Bowl XLV before moving to Tennessee Titans and then San Diego this year.The 27-year-old appeared in the first five games of the season, making two tackles and one sack, but the Chargers cut him from their roster.He wrote on Twitter: "It [is] a great feeling to be part of something special. I want to thank the Dallas Cowboys organization for a great opportunity."The Cowboys have also added running back Davin Meggett to their practice squad due to fitness fears over DeMarco Murray (knee) and Lance Dunbar (hamstring), however defensive tackle David Carter and cornerback Chris Greenwood have been released.
