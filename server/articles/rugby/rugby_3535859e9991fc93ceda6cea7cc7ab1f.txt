Chris Ivory of the New York Jets scores a touchdown against the New Orleans SaintsThe New York Jets ran the Saints into submission to spring an upset and inflict just a second defeat of the season on New Orleans thanks to a thumping ground game.High-flying Saints quarterback Drew Brees was put under pressure all game by a dogged Jets defence, and that combined with a punishing rushing attack led the hosts to a 26-20 victory at MetLife Stadium.Brees threw two touchdowns to star tight end Jimmy Graham during his 382-yard game, but his two interceptions both led to the two Jets touchdowns of the game just before half time.Nick Folk maintained his perfect run with four more field goals, and although rookie Jets QB managed just eight completions for 115 yards the dominance of their running game set them up for victory.Running back Chris Ivory was pumped up to face his old team, and he was the catalyst with 139 yards and a touchdown in a 200-yard rushing game for the Jets as a team.

Time and again the Saints defence, marshalled by Rob Ryan, the twin brother of Jets head coach Rex, failed to contain the Jets' ground game, while on the other side of the ball the Saints were forced to throw as they could only must 41 rushing yards.Tight end Graham caught nine passes for 166 yards and his two scores, but he was still noticeably struggling with a foot injury, and with Marques Colston ruled out of the game and Darren Sproles knocked out of it early on Brees struggled for receiving options.Not that Smith had any more success in the passing game with the Jets also shorn of options, but the rookie was trailing wide receiver Josh Cribbs with just 17 passing yards midway through the second quarter after Cribbs had a successful throw out of the wildcat.Brees struck first with his 51-yrad TD pass to Graham, who muscled his way over dragging a Jets defender with him, and Smith on the other side struggled in the red zone as they settled for a second Folk field goal.Brees and Graham repeated the dose midway through the second quarter and at 14-6 it looked like being a long day for the Jets as the Saints looked for a seventh win of the season.However, the Jets' offensive line was making plenty of holes for Ivory to run through, and he broke off on a couple of long runs before finding the end zone from three yards after Brees was picked off.Antonio Cromartie then grabbed a second interception for the Jets on the next series when Nick Toon had bobbled a catch from Brees - and five plays later Smith had run into the end zone from three yards out.A third interception was chalked off for a defensive holding call, and when Folk booted a 47-yarder the lead was nine and things got increasingly desperate for the Saints, who had a one-dimensional attack with the running game non-existent.That inability to run cost Sean Payton's men when he did not have enough confidence to run the ball straight up the middle when facing a third and fourth and inches and they turned the ball over on downs.Folk kicked another field goal to stretch the lead to nine and when they backed the Saints up with a punt the fearsome Jets defence did the rest to power them on to 5-4 and just a game behind the Patriots in the AFC East, while the Saints slip to 6-2.
