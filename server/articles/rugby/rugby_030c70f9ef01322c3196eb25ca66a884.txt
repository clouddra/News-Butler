    Fifty years ago New Zealand embarked upon a four-month tour of the British Isles, France and Canada.
    A hugely powerful and skilled side containing the likes of All Black greats Colin Meads and Don Clarke were to play 36 games and lose just one, with Newport RFC the team to claim the most famous win in their history.
    Wilson Whinneray's 1963 All Blacks arrived in the northern hemisphere towards the end of October and warmed-up with a 19-3 win over Oxford University, before thrashing Southern Counties 32-3 in Hove.
    On 30 October the Kiwis arrived at a wet and blustery Rodney Parade to face a Black and Ambers side whose early-season form gave little indication that their Welsh opponents would provide much of a contest for one of the finest touring sides in New Zealand rugby history.
    Newport had managed just six wins and two draws from their opening 12 matches, but the Welsh side's 13th fixture was to prove unlucky for New Zealand.
