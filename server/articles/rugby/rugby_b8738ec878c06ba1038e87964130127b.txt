Rhys Preistland - in the red jersey of Scarlets - may be wearing the same colour next weekend against the AussiesRhys Priestland is in line to make his Test recall when Wales play their opening autumn international at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff next week.The Scarlets' fly-half missed the entire Six Nations tournament this year after rupturing his Achilles tendon two weeks before Christmas while playing in the Heineken Cup.Priestland returned to action ahead of schedule five months later but suffered a recurrence of the injury in May which set him back further.The 26-year-old has played for the Scarlets during the early months of the current campaign, with Wales coach Warren Gatland expected to name him in his starting XV to face Australia next Saturday.Priestland, whose most recent Test was also against the Wallabies in November of 2012, admitted he had endured a tough 12 months.He said: "It has not been the best of years for me but you have to take the positives. I feel refreshed and so does my body."It is not the easiest to deal with an injury like that but it is not the end of the world."I am just enjoying playing rugby again after being out for so long."It makes you reflect on things and you get to realise how lucky you are to be a rugby player and doing something you like."The toughest thing for me was the game in Ulster when I came back and the injury occurred again."I had six weeks off doing nothing at all and that was probably the best thing for me because I came back refreshed and I look forward to turning up to training."It is such a big difference to 12 months ago when my body was in bits and I did not enjoy turning up to work."It was a drag getting through training and games but now there are no issues at all."It is nice getting out of bed in the morning with your body feeling normal."
