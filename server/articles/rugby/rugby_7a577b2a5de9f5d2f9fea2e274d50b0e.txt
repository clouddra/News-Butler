Tony Smith: Has hailed the 'high quality' addition of Matthew RussellWarrington have secured the signing of 20-year-old former Wigan full-back Matthew Russell from NRL club Gold Coast Titans.Russell, who was born in Irvine and is set to make his debut for Scotland at the upcoming World Cup, will join the Wolves on a two-year deal from next month.The former England academy international made six Super League appearances for Hull in 2012 while on loan from Wigan, where he was the understudy to Sam Tomkins.He moved to Australia 12 months ago and was part of the Titans' Under-20s team this year but has now moved back to England."I'm excited about Matty coming back to the UK. I think he'll come back a much better player than when he left - and he was already a very good player," Wolves coach Tony Smith said."I'm excited about him. He's young and very, very talented. He's eager to learn and improve and he fits the mould that we are looking for in Warrington. We don't bring many in and they've got to be of high quality. He's got a great attitude and I really look forward to working with him."Russell, who made just two appearances for the Warriors after coming through their junior ranks, will help fill the void created by the departure of veteran Australian full-back Brett Hodgson.Russell said: "I know a few of the lads already and they all say positive things about the club."It was a good culture in Australia and I've trained and played with arguably the best in the world, which has helped me as a person too."I've kept up-to-date with the Super League and look forward to getting back into it but not the cold weather! I'm really looking forward to my two years - and maybe more - at Warrington under Tony Smith."
