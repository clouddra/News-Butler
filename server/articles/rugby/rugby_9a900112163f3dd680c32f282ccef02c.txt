Lewis said: "We've started talking. We have to start that planning for the national team now."We had a great night on the Sunday after that third Lions Test in Sydney, we're going away (this week), just the two of us, take some time off-site and then we'll have a better idea of what's happening post-2015."Gatland has won three Six Nations titles and two Grand Slams since taking over in November 2007, and Lewis believes he can help develop the next generation of Welsh stars."At this level of the game, it's not one year, two years or three years (of planning)," said Lewis."We run a five-year cycle and that's the attitude we've brought into the game here in Wales, and that's the conversation we'll have."It's got to be what's right for Warren and his life, and his family. The other bits, in terms of the career, slot in."(The contract discussions) will be over a beer. I'll ask him, 'How do you feel? What do you think about the future?' And that will take as long as it takes."
