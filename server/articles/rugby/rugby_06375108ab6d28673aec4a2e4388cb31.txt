    Barrow have signed South Wales Scorpions duo Joe Burke and Dalton Grant, full-back Ross Brookes and former Whitehaven centre Matty Palmer.
    Wales forward Burke and winger Grant, both 23, have Super League experience having played for the now defunct Wrexham-based side Celtic Crusaders.
    Brookes joins from Cumbrian amateur side Millom, formerly managed by 
    
new Raiders coach Anthony Murray.
    He has now made five new signings after 
    
full-back Ian Mort joined in October.
