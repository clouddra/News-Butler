Jimmy Keinhorst: New Leeds contractLeeds have given centre Jimmy Keinhorst a new three-year contract that keeps him at Headingley until the end of the 2016 season.The 23-year-old, a Germany international, played for the Rhinos in the 2012 Challenge Cup final at Wembley while still a student at Leeds Metropolitan University.He spent much of the 2013 season on a dual registration at Hunslet, where he scored 13 tries in 15 appearances, but remains firmly part of Brian McDermott's plans at the Rhinos."We are delighted that Jimmy has agreed the new deal and I look forward to seeing him develop even further over the next three years," McDermott said."Securing Jimmy adds to the strength in our squad and that will be important next season."He showed great maturity last season to continue to work hard on his game whilst at Hunslet Hawks and earned a recall to the first team through his own commitment and attitude which bodes well for his future development."
