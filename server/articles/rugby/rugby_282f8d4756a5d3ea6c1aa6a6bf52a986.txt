    Warrington Wolves have signed young full-back Matthew Russell from Australian side Gold Coast Titans.
    The 20-year-old, who came through the Wigan youth ranks and had a 
    
loan spell at Hull FC, 

     joins Wire on a two-year-deal after one season in the NRL.
    He was recently named in 
    
Scotland's 24-man squad 

     for the World Cup which starts later this month.
    "I'm excited about him; he's young and very, very talented," Wolves head coach Tony Smith said.
    "He's eager to learn and improve and he fits the mould that we are looking for in Warrington.
    "We don't bring many in and they've got to be of high quality. He's got a great attitude and I really look forward to working with him."
