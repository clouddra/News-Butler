    England suffer defeat at the hands of their old rivals Australia 
    
as they lose 20-14 

     in their Autumn Test international at Twickenham.
    The home side led into the break through Manu Tuilagi's try and three penalties from Toby Flood - but the Wallabies rallied in the second-half to secure the win.
    England have now won just one of their last five matches, with South Africa up next at Twickenham next Saturday.
