Kurtley Beale has ended his troubled spell with the Melbourne Rebels and re-signed for the New South Wales Waratahs.The Australia full-back had been linked with a move to rugby league last week but the end of a protracted transfer sees him return to the club he first signed for as a 16-year-old.His time in Melbourne culminated with a drunken assault on two Rebels team-mates and saw him spend a spell in counselling for issues relating to alcohol abuse.Beale returned to the international fold against the British and Irish Lions earlier this summer - missing a vital kick at the end of the first Test - but is not a part of Australia's squad for the Rugby Championship as he continues his recovery from an injured shoulder."I feel at home in Sydney, it's where my family are," Beale said."The Waratahs are a team going places and I'm really looking forward to playing some good, consistent rugby."I've made the decision to get my shoulder right, I hope this next year will be a big one for me."I'm excited by the World Cup on the horizon and I'm just looking forward to getting back to playing really good rugby, having a big year for the Waratahs and hopefully getting selected for the Wallabies."Australia coach Ewen McKenzie added: "It's really good news for Australian rugby and great news for the Waratahs, he's a high-quality player."Given the Waratahs brand of football, he'll really add to the mix there."I'm looking forward to having him back playing his best footy, that's obviously a good thing for the Wallabies."
