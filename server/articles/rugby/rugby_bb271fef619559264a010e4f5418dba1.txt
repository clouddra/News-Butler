Andy Farrell: Believes England can win all three of their Autumn international fixturesEngland defence coach Andy Farrell insists the team are confident they can win all three of their QBE Autumn internationals, starting with Saturday's clash against Australia.The Wallabies are first up this weekend at Twickenham and England also have further fixtures against Argentina and New Zealand respectively in the coming weeks.England have not beaten Australia since a 35-18 success in November 2010, however, that has not stopped Farrell from believing in Stuart Lancaster's squad.When asked if England could win all three of their Autumn internationals, Farrell told Sky Sports: "Course."Australia have a relatively new head coach in Ewen McKenzie and Farrell believes the Wallabies are improving with each game having lost the series to the British and Irish Lions over the summer."I think Australia, there was always going to be a little bit of a hangover after the Lions because it meant so much to those guys that were involved as well," he continued."Couple that together with a new coaching setup it's going to take a little bit of time, but that time has been six or seven games now and in the last two or three of them you've seen the performances coming out of them."So we know that they are going to be very dangerous come Saturday."Rugby league convert Joel Tomkins will make his debut for England at outside centre against Australia and Farrell, formerly of the Wigan Warriors himself, believes the Saracens ace is ready to prove himself at the highest level."Joel's said in front of the boys what an opportunity it is. For any new cap I think the biggest job really is to show to your team-mates that you're capable. He's certainly expressed that to his team-mates. He's ready to go."He's a guy that's played in a lot of big games and he knows what these types of games are all about so he knows that it's not just about him. He knows it's about the team and how they perform and that's been his main focus."
