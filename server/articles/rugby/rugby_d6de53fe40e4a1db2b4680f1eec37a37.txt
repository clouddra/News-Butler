    Hull KR have signed Catalan Dragons forward Kevin Larroyer on a season-long loan deal.
    The 24-year-old France international made 17 appearances for the Dragons last season.
    Coach Craig Sandercock told 
    
the Rovers website:Â  

     "Kevin is a very good young player and we are very excited to have been able to get him on-board. 
    "He has a tremendous future in the game and everyone here is really looking forward to working with him."
    Larroyer's departure comes a week after Catalans made their first close-season signing by bringing in 29-year-old Australian centre Ben Pomeroy.
    The former Penrith player has played over 160 matches in the Australian NRL and left Cronulla to sign a two-year contract in Perpignan.
