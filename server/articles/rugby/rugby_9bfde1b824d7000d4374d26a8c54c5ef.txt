    Gareth Hock tells BBC North West Tonight's Richard Askam that he is embarrassed to have been removed from England's World Cup squad for a breach of discipline.
    The 30-year-old says he went on a night out with some of his team-mates following England's surprise defeat by Italy and overslept on Sunday morning, missing a recovery session.
    Hock adds that he feels unfairly treated and was unhappy to be told of his dismissal from the squad via a phone conversation with coach Steve McNamara.
    Viewers in the BBC North West region can watch the full extended interview in North West Tonight on BBC One at 18:30 BST on Wednesday evening.
