"We're able to do things like get a fresh start in the NFL, which you couldn't do over here. We can change the culture, change the players which is very difficult to do here."Having become 'London's team' for the next four years, starting on Sunday, the Jaguars are the first name in the frame for a possible UK outpost of the NFL if that does come to happen in the future.Khan insists, though, that he is only thinking of the next four years and that a possible London NFL team is still some way off."We're absolutely looking forward to it, we have been for a while. We were over here over a year ago so we're glad it's finally here."It's a big commitment to Wembley and to London, but I think it's way too early to think about a team being based over here - if you look at it, it's the first year with two games.

Daily news, interviews and analysis from all 32 NFL teams six days a week."We're the first team and the only team that's committed to play here for more than one year, which is for four years. Next year there'll be three games here so it's a long time to go, you've got to decide if it makes sense and we haven't got all the facts."For us our commitment is four games over four years in London, that's our commitments right now."Having had a look around Fulham's Craven Cottage, Khan said he could envisage staging a Jaguars home game there in the future - even if the venue is a lot smaller than the usual NFL home."Anything is possible, we're playing here once a year at Wembley and maybe we end up playing here - that's what I was talking to with our media from Jacksonville, this is like a high school game setting, so personal, so up close, it might be kind of fun."
