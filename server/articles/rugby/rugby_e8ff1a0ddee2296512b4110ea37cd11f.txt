Cooper impressing GeniaWill Genia is backing half-back partner Quade Cooper to inspire Australia to victory against England on Saturday.The mercurial fly-half showed signs of a return to his best form during the defeat to New Zealand in Dunedin earlier this month.Cooper had a 100 per cent goalkicking record during the Wallabies' 41-33 loss and made three try-saving tackles, and Genia believes his Queensland Reds teammate will replicate that good form in Saturday's Cook Cup decider at Twickenham.The scrum-half told Sky Sports News: "Quade's a very special player, someone who can create something from nothing with incredible x-factor."But I think some of his biggest strengths are his communication and organisation. He thinks very quickly on his feet and is able to organise and orchestrate a game. He does that very well for this group."I was a pleasure playing with him in Dunedin and hopefully we can build on that this week."Cooper's struggles have been compared with that of out-of-favour Wallaby James O'Connor, who has joined London Irish until the end of the season.Genia hopes the utility back can get his career back on track in the Aviva Premiership and will return to Australia a more mature player."At the end of the day James has to look after himself and his best interests," said Genia. "He obviously felt that getting out of the bubble of Australian rugby was the best thing for him to mature as a person."You can do it in two different ways. Quade chose to stay and work hard and push through all the issues that he faced, whereas James has chosen to go down a different path."Good luck to him, I hope he does well and comes out of it a better person more than anything else."Watch England v Australia live on Saturday at 1.30pm on Sky Sports 2
