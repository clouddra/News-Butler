Charlie Batch: No timescale on loan deal to LeedsBath prop Charlie Beech has joined Championship side Leeds Carnegie on an indefinite loan.The 26-year-old joined up with the Leeds squad earlier this week and could go straight into their side for Sunday's British and Irish Cup clash against Bristol.The former Wasps forward, who represented England at U20 level, has found first-team action hard to come by at Bath this season and has been snapped up by Leeds following injuries to James Currie and Ben Hooper.Leeds director of rugby Chris Gibson said: "We are pleased to have signed a player of Charlie's experience on loan from Bath."At present we have both James Currie and Ben Hooper unavailable due to injury in the key position of prop and this not only gives us cover in that position but also brings quality player into our group."At present there is no timescale for the length of the loan deal and we will continue to liaise with Bath."
