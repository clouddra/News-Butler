England say they will work with Leeds to support Hardaker, who has asked for privacy.Hardaker did not play in either of England's first two matches against Australia and Ireland.McNamara put his absence down to illness and responded angrily to suggestions from the media that  Hardaker was set to become the second player to be thrown out of the squad for a breach of discipline.Hardaker was thought to be among the group of players who broke an alcohol ban in the aftermath of England's shock defeat by Italy in a warm-up match at Salford on October 19.Gareth Hock was thrown out of the squad for sleeping in and missing the following morning's recovery session.Hock revealed in a television interview that "six or seven" players in all were involved in the drinking session and claimed McNamara had told him they would also be punished.Prop forward James Graham was a notable absentee when McNamara named his team for the World Cup opener against Australia in Cardiff but returned to face the Irish.Hardaker has only won one cap, against Wales last year, but he was man of the match in England Knights' 52-16 win over Samoa last month.
