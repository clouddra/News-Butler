    Cardiff Blues director of rugby Phil Davies was delighted with replacement Gareth Davies' dramatic winning try in their 
    
19-15 Heineken Cup win over Toulon.
    The Welsh region's boss told BBC Radio Wales' Nick Webb he thought the fly-half had been tackled.
    But the player's "Jack-in-a-box" reaction allowed him to score.
