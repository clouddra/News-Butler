    Barrow Raiders have signed prop forward Jack Morrison from 2013 Super League runners-up Warrington Wolves.
    The 21-year-old spent last term on loan at Championship rivals Swinton where he played almost every game until injuring his hand at the end of the campaign.
    He is 
    
new Raiders coach Anthony Murray's 

     sixth close-season signing.
    Joe Burke, Dalton Grant, Ross Brookes and Matty Palmer all 
    
arrived late last month, 

     a week after 
    
the signing of full-back Ian Mort.
    "We've have been after Jack for a while and it's a great signing. It's a bonus that he's been in this league before," said director of rugby Andy Gaffney.
