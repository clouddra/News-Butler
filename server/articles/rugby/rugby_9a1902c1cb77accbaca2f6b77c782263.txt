Ryan Hall: Has scored 17 tries for EnglandRyan Hall's Rugby League World Cup hat-trick against Ireland might have made him England's all-time leading try-scorer but he insists his place in the side is not guaranteed.The Leeds winger scored three of England's eight tries, all in a 20-minute spell early in the game, to put them on their way to a 42-0 rout of the Irish in front of a stadium record 24,375 crowd at Huddersfield.It took his total to 17 in as many matches for his country and edged him ahead of full-back Sam Tomkins, who had gone into the game as England's top try-scorer."I didn't realise at the time that I'd got the record but that's pretty cool," Hall said. "There's a lot of competition in front of us, though. I'm sure there are plenty more tries to be scored."Hall, who had the distinction of scoring the first try of the 2013 World Cup in England's opening-day defeat by Australia, looks assured of the number five jersey, with Tom Briscoe, who will soon be a Rhinos team-mate, battling it out with Josh Charnley for the right-wing spot, but he begs to differ."I don't think it's just those two battling it out for a spot, it's three of us battling for two spots," Hall said."All three can play on either wing and, if any one of us has a bad game or gets a niggling injury, we'll be dropped straight away."The competition for places makes it a healthy side, you can't rest on your laurels in any game."That goes for any position and that's credit to Steve Mac, who's put a good foundation in place. He selects the side and he gives himself a headache."Charnley, whose try against the Kangaroos in Cardiff was his 44th of the year, surprisingly made way at Huddersfield for Briscoe, who seized his opportunity by scoring two tries to provide coach Steve McNamara with a selection dilemma ahead of Saturday's final group A match against Fiji at Hull's KC Stadium.That match will determine the runners-up spot after the Fijiians went down 34-2 to tournament favourites Australia at St Helens.Petero Civoniceva's men had begun the tournament with a 32-14 win over Ireland and look capable of giving England a run for their money but Hall believes Saturday's victory has enabled them to get their campaign back on course."We started with a loss so we knew how important it was to get back on the right track and we did that in the first half," Hall said. "I think things are looking good."
