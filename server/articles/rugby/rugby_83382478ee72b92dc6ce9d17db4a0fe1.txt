Chris Ashton: Showing his form for Saracens this seasonEngland backs coach Andy Farrell feels Chris Ashton has rediscovered the hunger that made him one of the most dangerous wings in the game.Ashton's stock dropped dramatically last season and there were calls for him to be dropped by coach Stuart Lancaster.But he has returned to form with a vengeance for Saracens this season and could be back in Lancaster's starting XV when he names his side for the opening QBE International with Australia early next month."Chris has dealt with things superbly well," Farrell said. "He's had to realise that the reason the scrutiny is on him is because he has done superbly well in the past."Everyone has a slight slump but he's been able to get back on the horse."There are a lot of things that have improved in his game, but the main thing is the intent."You can see the fire and the hunger back in him. He wants on get on with it without making any excuses. He is letting his rugby do the talking and that is what we all want to see."Without a shadow of doubt he is one of the best finishers in the game. He knows what he must work on, but his X-factor is his ability to score tries and be in the right place all the time."He has shown intent in his game and he has never lost that this season."Even though he has adapted his game a little bit, whenever there is a break, whether he scores it or not, he is there. You want a wing with try-scoring ability, no doubt about that."England's November international series will be live on Sky Sports - beginning with Australia on November 2
