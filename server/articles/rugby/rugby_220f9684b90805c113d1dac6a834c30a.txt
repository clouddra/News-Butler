Golden Tate: Bagged two touchdowns for victorious Seattle SeahawksThe Seattle Seahawks survived a nervy finish to beat NFC West rivals the St Louis Rams 14-9 in Monday night's NFL match-up.Golden Tate's two touchdowns proved decisive as Kellen Clemens, standing in for injured Rams quarterback Sam Bradford, was unable to get his side in the end zone despite 134 rushing yards from rookie Zac Stacy.Seattle were limited to minus-one yard in the first quarter and trailed to a Greg Zuerlein field goal, but went ahead with Tate's two-yard touchdown catch six minutes before half-time.Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson had to scramble to avoid a safety early in the third as the Rams' pass rush, led by Robert Quinn and Chris Long with three sacks apiece, ran riot.Tate struck again on an 80-yard catch and run, though he incurred a 15-yard penalty enforced on the kick-off for taunting safety Rodney McLeod as he raced into the end zone.Zuerlein kicked his third goal but then missed from 50 yards, meaning his side required a touchdown on their final drive, and Clemens' pass to Brian Quick was tipped away by Brandon Browner to end the game and take Seattle to a 7-1 record. The Rams prop up the division at 3-5.
