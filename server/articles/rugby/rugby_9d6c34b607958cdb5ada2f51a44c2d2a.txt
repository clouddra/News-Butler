Hull KR have confirmed the signing of Papua New Guinea internationals Enoch Maki and Francis Paniu.They will join up with Craig Sandercock's squad when they return for pre-season training later in the year but, in the meantime, Robins fans might get their first glimpse of them, as well as another new signing, Neville Costigan, when the Kumuls play France and Samoa in the World Cup at Craven Park.Maki, a hard-hitting prop, and Paniu, a second rower, are from Papua New Guinea's domestic competition and join the Robins on the recommendation of former Kumuls favourite, Stanley Gene, who joined the Robins after impressing at the 1995 World Cup and is now on their coaching staff.Hull KR chief executive Mike Smith said: "We have great links with PNG and these signings are another example of that. I'm sure those fans that turn out for the RLWC2013 games will be impressed with what they see and I'd urge as many Robins' supporters as possible to turn out and welcome the boys to east Hull."Maki, who plays with Mendi Muruks, said: "I'm looking forward to the challenge. It will be a lot of hard work but this is a great opportunity for us."We will be learning every day and taking as much as we can from the coaching staff at the club."
