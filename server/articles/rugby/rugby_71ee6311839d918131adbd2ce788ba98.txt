Jack Warrington: Handed two-year suspension for Anti-Doping violationJack Warrington (Sedgley Park RF) has been suspended for two years for an Anti Doping violation by the Rugby Football Union.Warrington tested positive for prohibited stimulant Methylhexaneamine after featuring for his side in an SSE National League One match against Loughborough Students in November 2012.Antony Davies, sitting as a Single Judicial Officer, has suspended him from November 23, 2012 until November 23, 2014.Mr Davies said: "Having heard from the player about his personal circumstances and the level at which he plays, it is not difficult to conclude that he may well not be a player who deliberately uses performance enhancing substances."I note his protestations of innocence and disavowal of motive. However they are not sufficient to discharge the burden of proof in this case and I simply cannot be satisfied as to how MHA came to be in the player's system. When a player tests positive, the burden of proof passes to him."This must be a wake-up call to players, whether professional or amateur, particularly with regard to the use of supplements."
