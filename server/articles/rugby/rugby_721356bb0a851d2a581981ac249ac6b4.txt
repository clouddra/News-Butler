Peyton Hillis celebrates his debut touchdown for the GiantsThe New York Giants snapped their six-game losing streak with a 23-7 victory over fellow strugglers Minnesota Vikings.The Giants had endured their worst start to the season since 1976 after going 0-6.However they finally got their season up and running after forcing the Vikings into making too many mistakes while keeping last season's MVP Adrian Peterson to just 28 yards.Josh Freeman, making his Vikings debut after his release from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, also endured a night to forget as he completed just 20-of-53 passes for 190 yards and one interception.For the Giants, Eli Manning completed 23-of-39 passes for 200 yards and one touchdown, while crucially the 32-year-old didn't throw an interception for the first time this season.Josh Brown had opened the scoring with a 35-yard field goal only for the Minnesota to respond via 86-yard punt return from Marcus Sherels.The Giants, though, moved into a lead they wouldn't lose in the second quarter as Manning connected with Rueben Randle with a 24-yard TD pass.Sherels was then guilty of fumbling without being hit to set up the position for Peyton Hillis, who only joined the Giants on Wednesday, to rush over from a yard.Brown finished off a 16-play drive with a 23-yard field goal, before he sealed the win with his third successful kick, this time from 36 yards."We needed to get one on the board," defensive end Justin Tuck said."Hopefully, tonight is something we can build off. It's still a long way to climb out of this hole. But this was something that we could get the ball rolling."
