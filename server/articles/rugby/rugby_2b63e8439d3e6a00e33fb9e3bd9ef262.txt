The Jacksonville Jaguars are hoping to defeat the San Francisco 49ers at Wembley this weekend after losing all seven of their matches this campaign.The Jacksonville Jaguars are desperate to kick-start their season when they host the San Francisco 49ers in the second game of the International Series at Wembley on Sunday.The Jaguars have the worst record in the NFL at 0-7 and are preparing to face a strong 49ers outfit that is second in the NFC West with a 5-2 record.Starting centre Brad Meester admits they have been having a tough time, but insists the team is optimistic heading into the London clash."San Francisco are an unbelievable team," he told Sky Sports News. "The season hasn't gone quite the way we wanted but things are getting better."Our focus has been on getting better each and every week and we're going to take that out there on Sunday. It's been awesome in London."But tight end DJ Williams insists the Jaguars have not been distracted by the fact that this home game - they are the designated home team for the match - is taking place in London."We know what we need to get done," he said. "We're all competitive and we're all professionals. We're not here to have fun. This is a business trip and that's how we're going to approach this week and the game. We need to get this win."It would be good way to beat a great team like the 49ers and that's what we're setting out to do."Cornerback Will Blackmon is expecting a bruising encounter, adding: "They are an extremely physical team."I played against them in the NFC championship game a couple of years ago when I was with the Giants and that game went to the wire. People were hurt after the game."It's going to be a physical battle - they are a very, very tough team."[i]Jacksonville Jaguars v San Francisco 49ers is live on Sky Sports 2 from 4pm on Sunday.[/i]
