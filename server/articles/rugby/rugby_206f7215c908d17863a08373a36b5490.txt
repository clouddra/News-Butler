George Burgess: Knee injury has England prop concernedGeorge Burgess has no intention of letting injury rule him out of England's vital World Cup clash with Fiji on Saturday.Prop Burgess played less than a quarter of the 42-0 win over Ireland on Saturday after taking a blow just below his right knee in the early moments.But he was able to watch the rest of the rout from the sidelines and is very hopeful Steve McNamara will be able to engineer a win over the Fijians in Hull next weekend which would be enough to secure a quarter-final berth."It's really swollen at the minute," said Burgess, who played on for another 15 minutes before coming off."I'll be working hard to get it right for next week and the rest of the tournament."I think it was my first carry so a bit of a nightmare there. These things happen in sport and you've got to get on with it."I'll definitely be trying to get it right for next week. I'll ice it up and it should be alright. I've not missed a game yet this year through injury and I don't intend to."It was great to get the first win of the tournament and hopefully we can get afew more."
