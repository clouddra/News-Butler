    "There is very little between these teams and they put us under a hell of a lot of pressure. It's the same every game I have played against the Boks, if you don't get it 100 per-cent right you are in trouble."

The flanker said: "We had to dig deep, both teams came here willing to play. We played with 14 men for  20 minutes, add into that a bit of travel, and it was a very satisfying win."Going behind we could easily have got flustered but the guys hung in there. We took our chances really well and there were times when we were under a lot of pressure and then got a critical turnover.""The try on half-time was critical. I'm sure it changed their half-time talk. But credit to the Boks, they came out in the second half and scored again quickly, though we were able to keep ourselves ahead in the game.""There is very little between these teams and they put us under a hell of a lot of pressure. It's the same every game I have played against the Boks, if you don't get it 100 per cent right you are in trouble."
