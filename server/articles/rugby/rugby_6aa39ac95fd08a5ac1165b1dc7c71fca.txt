    Scarlets head coach Simon Easterby was relieved his side salvaged a Heineken Cup draw against Racing Metro.
    The 
    
26-26 result 

     left Scarlets and Racing joint top of Pool Four with six points each.

“We probably will look back and see that today was a chance missed, but [we have] gone away to Harlequins and got a win”
    But Easterby admitted Scarlets rode their luck when Racing had a try ruled out in injury time.
    "Up until the 79th minute we would have been disappointed with the result, but then we got lucky," said Easterby.
    "We played into their hands a little bit and we are probably lucky not to come away with loss.
    "We have got to understand that we have not helped ourselves and we've given them opportunities - but there were lots of positives from the game. We showed a real intent at times."
    Scarlets face French Top 14 side Clermont Auvergne in back-to-back games when the Heineken Cup resumes in December.
    Easterby said he was content with six points from his side's opening two clashes against Racing and Harlequins.
    But the former Ireland flanker admitted his players were disappointed not win the home game.
    "We probably will look back and see that today was a chance missed, but [we have] 
    
gone away to Harlequins 

     and got a win," he said.
