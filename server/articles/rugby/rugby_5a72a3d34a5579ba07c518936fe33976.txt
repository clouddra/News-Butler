    Ah, the 
    
Heineken Cup. 

     I suspect the days of automatic qualification for both Scottish clubs, and three of the four Irish and Welsh sides, are gone forever. The current system is not fair.
    I've always found the contrast between Celtic, and French or English rugby, very interesting. We 
    
Scots, and our Celtic cousins in Ireland and Wales, 

     obliterated our club game when professionalism arrived. It was cast aside. 
    There was an unseemly haste to tailor our game to the new world of elite level cups, TV money and overseas adventure.
    That destruction of the club game was wrapped up with a need to control the players so that we might stay at the very highest levels of the international game.
