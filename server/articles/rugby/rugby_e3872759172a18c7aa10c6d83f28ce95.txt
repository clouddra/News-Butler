    Wales are the first side eliminated from the Rugby League World Cup 
    
after they were beaten 24-16 by the USA Tomahawks 

     at the Racecourse ground in Wrexham.
    Despite scoring first through Christiaan Roets, the Americans responded with five unanswered tries before a late rally from the home side ensured a respectable score-line.
    The USA have become one of the surprise packages of the tournament after winning both their opening matches and will face Scotland on Thursday.
