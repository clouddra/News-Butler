Matt Scott: Still haunted by last year's defeat to Tonga in AberdeenScotland centre Matt Scott has warned his side not to underestimate the threat of Japan in their first autumn international this weekend.Scott is anxious to avoid a repeat of the shock 21-15 defeat to Tonga at Pittodrie last year when the Brave Blossums visit Murrayfield on Saturday.Scott Johnson's side face far tougher Tests against South Africa and Australia later this month, and Scott knows the importance of going into those encounters on the back of a victory."We saw last year at Pittodrie what can happen if you don't take these games seriously enough," he said. "We don't want that happening to us again."We recovered pretty quickly from that Tonga defeat and did well in the Six Nations. But the feeling of that day is still ingrained in everybody's memory."I had only won six caps before that game and I was pretty new to things then. It wasn't a pleasant experience at all and it's not something I want to be repeating."Johnno has told us to play each Test like it's our last. Japan are a quality side and we can't take them lightly. Okay, they are an emerging nation but they have beaten the likes of Fiji and the Unites States, good teams."They will be targeting us for a win and will be a very dangerous side. We will put our strongest side out, but we will still need to give it our all."The performance is the thing we should be focusing on mainly, because if we play well I think we will win."There's no doubt about that and I'm confident we are good enough to take care of Japan."But it's no good losing the first game when we have to massive sides in South Africa and Australia to come next, so the result does matter too."
