Dan Lydiate: Believes Racing should be challenging for domestic and European honoursWales flanker Dan Lydiate is targeting Heineken Cup glory with Racing Metro this season.The Top 14 side have shown their ambition by signing big names such as Jonathan Sexton, Jamie Roberts and Lydiate during the summer.Given the strength of their squad, Lydiate believes the club should be firmly in the mix for both domestic and European honours.Asked if he has set a specific goal for the season, Lydiate said: "To try to be involved with the squad as much as I can."In the last few seasons Racing have got to the knockout stages of the Heineken Cup and this year's no different."We want to be there at the end of the season. I am really excited about playing in the Heineken Cup."Lydiate is one of a host of Welsh stars now plying their trade in France and he dismissed fears the move would affect his international career."Obviously you are maybe at a slight disadvantage because the coach is not able to watch you every week but I just hope if I am playing well enough they'll still pick me," he said."It's a massive onus on myself to make sure I am playing well out here. If Racing are successful as well there's a bigger chance I'll still be selected for Wales."I spoke to Warren (Gatland) before coming out here to make sure I was still available."
