Jamie Roberts: Could be sidelined for over two monthsJamie Roberts is a major doubt for Wales' autumn internationals after undergoing ankle surgery.The British and Irish Lions centre suffered the injury while playing for Racing Metro two weeks ago."The doctors seem to think I'll be out for a good few months," said Roberts, who has won 53 caps for his country and scored five tries.

"But I will be working on my rehab, trying my best to be fit for selection."Racing Metro assistant coach Laurent Labit says that Roberts faces "at least two months" on the sidelines."Jamie has reported back to us after 10 days in Cardiff for the operation," said Labit."He will be out for at least two months after surgery and will hopefully be back playing some time in November, but he will probably miss the Wales Tests."Wales kick off their autumn campaign against South Africa on 9 November and then face Argentina, Tonga and Australia.However, the Wallabies fixture - which takes place in Cardiff on 30 November - falls outside the International Rugby Board autumn international window, which means Racing would be under no obligation to release Roberts for that game, even if fit.Roberts joined the exodus of Welsh internationals to France last summer when he left Cardiff Blues for Racing Metro.But injuries have restricted the 26-year-old to just three appearances for the Top 14 side, who have won five of their opening seven games of the season.
