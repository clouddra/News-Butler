Brett Favre: No interest in return to NFL with the RamsBrett Favre has reportedly turned down advances from the St Louis Rams to help them out of their quarterback crisis.Favre, 44, retired from the NFL in 2010 after a glittering career that spanned nearly 20 years and included a Super Bowl victory as well as 11 Pro Bowl appearances.ESPN NFL analyst Adam Schefter claimed on Twitter on Thursday that the Rams called Favre to sound out his interest in another comeback to replace their injured quarterback Sam Bradford.Schefter tweeted: "St. Louis called Brett Favre, asking if the 44-year-old QB if he would be willing to play. Favre declined."Bradford suffered a season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament in their defeat by Carolina last weekend, leaving the Rams short of options to lead their stuttering offense.The injury left the Rams down to only Kellen Clemens on their active roster who could play quarterback, but they have since signed Brady Quinn and Austin Davis, who have been practicing with the team this week.Six-year veteran Quinn was released by the New York Jets on Monday and Davis was on the Rams roster last season and during training camp before the 2013 campaign got underway - he later briefly joined up with the Miami Dolphins."It's been a tough six weeks, and it feels like two years," Davis said."Just kind of sitting around waiting and just trying to get back in here. It's unfortunate, Sam's a good friend and he was really playing well this year, so it's not an ideal situation, but I've got a job to do."
