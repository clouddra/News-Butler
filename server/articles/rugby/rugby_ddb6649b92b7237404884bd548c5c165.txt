Will Genia: Recalled by the WallabiesAustralia have recalled scrum-half Will Genia for Saturday's final Rugby Championship Test in Argentina.Genia comes in for Nic White in the only change to the starting line-up from that beaten 28-8 by South Africa in Cape Town last weekend.White drops to the bench for the wooden-spoon showdown at Estadio Gigante de Arroyito in Rosario, 300km north west of Buenos Aires.There is also one change among the replacements with utility back Bernard Foley coming in for Chris Feauai-Sautia, scorer of the Wallaby try against the Springboks.Papua New Guinea-born No 9 Genia, 25, has skippered Australia this year in the absence of injured lock James Horwill but was axed by coach Ewen McKenzie after a humiliating 26-point drubbing by South Africa in Brisbane.White impressed sufficiently to stay on the pitch for the full 80 minutes next time out as Australia squeezed a 14-13 home win over the Pumas in a dour duel.But his field-kicking came unstuck in Cape Town and the Wallabies fared far better when Genia came on for the second half.Australia have four points and Argentina two after five rounds, meaning the losers of the final 2013 Rugby Championship fixture get the unwanted wooden spoon.The Wallabies have a slight historical advantage in previous meetings on Argentine soil with four victories, three defeats and one draw.Australia: Folau, Ashley-Cooper, Kuridrani, Lealiifano, Tomane, Cooper, Genia, Mowen, Hooper, Fardy, Horwill, Simmons, Alexander, Moore, Slipper.Replacements: Fainga'a, Robinson, Kepu, Timani, McCalman, White, Toomua, Foley.Watch Argentina v Australia on Sky Sports 4 HD from 11.40pm Saturday.
