    "This is my club, it's my home and I'm proud to represent Hull FC," he said.

“Our aim now is to get back there and win and finally show we can become a consistent force in Super League”
    "I have had a great 10 years with the club, but I am just as excited about the future now as I was when I joined in 2004."
    During his time at Hull, Whiting has been capped three times by England, was named Super League's Young Player of the Year in 2005 and lifted the Challenge Cup in the same year.
    However, he has been a the losing finalist in both the Grand Final and the Challenge Cup, the latter coming in

    "It's a dream come true to earn a testimonial with the club, as it was to finally walk out at Wembley," added Whiting.
    "Our aim now is to get back there and win and finally show we can become a consistent force in Super League. I can't wait to play my part in that again next season."
