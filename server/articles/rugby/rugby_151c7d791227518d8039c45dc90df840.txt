    Sam Tomkins says it is "unbelievable" to finish his Wigan Warriors career with 
    
victory in the Super League Grand Final 

     to add to August's Challenge Cup win.
    The England full-back, 
    
is joining NRL side New Zealand Warriors 

    , says that the victory is all the more special after Wigan were "written off" at the start of the season.
    The Warriors completed a record Grand Final comeback having trailed 16-2 shortly before half-time, by hitting back with 28 unanswered points for a 30-16 win.
