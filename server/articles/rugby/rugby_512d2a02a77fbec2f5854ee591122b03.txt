Commentary of Wales v United States and Wales v Cook Islands at bbc.co.uk/sportwales.  Plus every match live on BBC Radio 5 or 5 live sports extra    Clive Griffiths is a name synonymous with Welsh rugby league. The former St Helens player was in charge of Wales for two memorable World Cup campaigns in 1995 and 2000.
    Wales lost 25-10 to England in that 1995 semi-final and a side captained by Iestyn Harris gave Australia an almighty scare before losing 46-22 at the same stage five years later.
    Griffiths has also spent a spell as assistant to current head coach Harris, who has been in charge of the national side since 2009.
    Here, North Wales Crusaders head coach Griffiths looks forward to Wales' fourth World Cup campaign, which begins against Italy at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday.
    "Iestyn's still pretty young as a coach. He's very cool, as he was as a player. I get a bit more animated than Iestyn but we're all different in styles.
    "He knows the game inside-out and all he needs now is the coaching experience to go with it and the man-management skills which develop as you go along. 
Iestyn Harris has been Wales head coach since 2009
