England go into the game on the back of a 20-13 win over Australia in their opening Autumn International last weekend.Coach Stuart Lancaster added Bath's Anthony Watson to the squad on Sunday - the full-back is already an U20 international and has been called up to gain top-level experience.Lancaster said: "We are bringing Anthony Watson into camp because we want to take a look at him in the same way that we have done in the past with others outside the Senior or Saxons squads such as Joe Launchbury."Anthony is a member of the Under-20s squad and is playing well for Bath so this is a good opportunity to give him a taste of this environment."Prop Alex Corbisiero and second row Geoff Parling are expected to be available to face Argentina after missing the game against Australia due to injury.Sky Sports News will be with Lancaster and members of his squad as they begin their preparations this afternoon.
