Israel Folau: No move back to rugby league for Wallabies wingerIsrael Folau has ended lingering talk about a return to rugby league by signing a new two-year deal with the Australian Rugby Union.The 24-year-old winger, who made a massive impact with two tries on his international debut against the British and Irish Lions in June, had been courted by a number of NRL teams.Folau began his career in league, making his Test debut at the age of 18, and won multiple State Of Origin series with Queensland before making a move to Australian Rules Football with the GWS Giants.He joined union's New South Wales Waratahs at the end of 2012 and such was his impact, Folau earned an international call for the Lions series, scoring twice on his bow in Brisbane.He said: "I've really enjoyed my first year for the Waratahs and being with the Wallabies."Next year is going to be an exciting year for both and I've still got more to offer. That's the reason I decided to stay."The Rugby World Cup (2015) is definitely a drawcard. To be part of that would be an awesome experience, but that's a long way away and we have a lot to achieve in the meantime."I really enjoy what I am doing at the moment with rugby, and looking down the track there's a lot of exciting things coming up - I want to be a part of that."
