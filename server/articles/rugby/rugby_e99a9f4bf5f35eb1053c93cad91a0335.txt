    The Scarlets made best use of the difficult conditions to earn a deserved eight-point Pro12 win over Ulster.
    A George Earle try helped the home side to an 11-3 half-time lead, with Steve Shingler and Aled Thomas kicking a penalty apiece for the Scarlets.
    Ruan Pienaar landed one penalty in the first half and two in the second but Ulster failed to secure a bonus point as their six-match unbeaten run ended.
    Thomas kicked two penalties after the break as Scarlets secured the victory.

    The Scarlets then enjoyed a sustained period of pressure and put together several dozen phases of play on the Ulster line, but the visitors defended stoutly and were eventually able to clear.
    Replacement John Barclay did breach the Ulster defence with a piercing run but a good covering tackle from Paul Marshall denied the Scot a possible try.
    Shingler knocked over a penalty from in front of the posts in the 22nd minute and nine minutes later the Scarlets converted their territorial dominance into further points when Earle rumbled over for his try.
    The second row touched down after good work by his fellow forwards, but Shingler was unable to add the extra two points.
    Flanker Barclay broke through the Ulster rearguard again soon after but Marshall managed to hold onto him in the tackle as he made a dash for the line.
    An Aled Thomas penalty just before half-time increased the Scarlets' advantage to eight points.
