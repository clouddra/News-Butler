Wide receiver Brandon Marshall celebrates a touchdown against the New York GiantsThe struggling New York Giants remain winless after they slumped to a 27 -21 loss to the Chicago Bears.The Giants, who won the Super Bowl two years ago, fall to 0-6 for the first time since 1976 - the year that they lost their first nine games.There was little to choose between the two sides early on before the Bears (4-2) opened up a decisive lead towards the end of the second quarter.Jay Cutler threw two touchdowns as he completed 24-of-36 passes for 262 yards for the Bears, while Tim Jennings (2) and Zack Bowman picked off three Eli Manning's passes."We are a young offence, it's a new offence, we're still building that chemistry not only with players but with the players and coaches," said Bears wide receiver Brandon Marshall."I think as we get into the season a little deeper our offence will be even more efficient."Jennings opened the scoring with a 48-yard interception return before Brandon Jacobs levelled the match with a four-yard run.Cutler connected with Marshall with a 10-yard pass to make it 14-7 only for New York to come back into the game through Manning's 37-yard TD pass to Rueben Randle.However the Bears were 24-14 up at the break as Cutler and Marshall linked up once again - this time from three yards out - while Robbie Gould slotted over a 40-yard field goal.Gould extended the lead to 13 points with a 52-yard field goal, before Jacobs, who rushed for 106 yards in total, scooted over from a yard.The Giants desperately pushed for the match-turning touchdown however Jennings made a timely interception late on as Manning attempted to find tight end Brandon Myers at the 12 with 1:54 left.Manning finished with 14-of-26 completed passes for 239 yards and a touchdown."We played hard, we fought, we did a lot of good things, but not enough," said Giants coach Tom Coughlin.
