Stuart Lancaster was delighted that his side did not panic at half-timeStuart Lancaster praised his younger England players as they beat Australia in a game he thought they could have lost last year.England emerged with a 20-13 victory against the Wallabies at Twickenham thanks mainly to an increase in intensity in the second half.The hosts scored 14 points while stopping the visitors from adding to their half time score, and Lancaster picked out his side's composure as a real plus point."I'm pleased to get the win," said Lancaster. "We conceded a couple of penalties and a soft try, but I was pleased with the composure we showed in the second half."We had a lot of young lads making their first starts at Twickenham. I think we deserved it in the end."Lancaster admitted the first half was a tough test, and said it was only late on in the game that England finally got things right."We did not have it all our own way in the first half," he added. "It was a stop-start first half with a lot of kicking from both sides and we did not get the momentum we wanted."The second half was better. We did not get everything right until the last 20 minutes. I'm delighted with the effort."
