Argentina's Juan Martin Hernandez in action against the All Blacks in early SeptemberJuan Martin Hernandez will miss Argentina's trip to Twickenham on November 9, after tearing a right thigh muscle during training.In addition to the clash with England, the full-back is also expected to miss his country's other autumn internationals against Wales and Italy.The Argentine Rugby Union announced that Hernandez suffered the injury during a session with his French club Racing Metro.Even before the blow to Hernandez, Pumas coach Daniel Hourcade had resigned himself to having to name his squad ahead of each match - rather than the entire tour itself.Hourcade, who had listed 31 players to cover the three Tests, is already down to 27 with the coach having to negotiate the release of players from their European clubs who earlier had to do without their Argentine stars for 10 weeks during the southern hemisphere's Rugby Championship.Forwards Eusebio Guinazu and Leonardo Senatore, along with centre Gabriel Ascarate, are also out of the squad for the Twickenham Test.Two absentees for the whole tour are Leicester wing Gonzalo Camacho and Montpellier front row forward Juan Figallo both of whom are recovering from serious injuries.Also missing is skipper Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe who fractured an elbow playing for Toulon on Saturday.Hourcade has yet to name his captain for the forthcoming fixtures.
