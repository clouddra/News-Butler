     Hi Jerry, do you think Courtney Lawes' strong performance against Castres last week and his 

man-of-the-match display against Ospreys this week
     are enough to earn a starting spot in the England second row for the autumn internationals ahead of Geoff Parling or Joe Launchbury?

    Hi marchthe14th, without doubt Lawes has put in some headline performances recently and they will have caught the eye of England boss Stuart Lancaster. 
    In my opinion he's a better player this season for adding an attacking element to his play, rather than just looking for the next player to tackle. Lawes' timing couldn't have been better and personally I would pick him ahead of Parling for the first Test, against Australia on 2 November, but I think Lancaster will select Parling. It's all very close though.
