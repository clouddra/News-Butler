Matt Schaub: Will be replaced by Case Keenum against the Kansas City ChiefsHouston Texans quarterback Matt Schaub and Philadelphia Eagles signal-caller Michael Vick have been ruled out of their respective teams' Week Seven games.Schaub was forced out of the Texans' heavy loss to the St Louis Rams with a leg and ankle injury and will not be ready for the visit to Arrowhead Stadium to play the Kansas City Chiefs.The 32-year-old had been struggling for form prior to the injury, setting an NFL record by throwing an interception returned for a touchdown in four straight games.TJ Yates replaced him against the Rams but head coach Gary Kubiak has now opted to start undrafted second-year man Keenum, who will go up against the NFL's fifth-ranked defence.

Keenum is a Texas native who played for the University of Houston, where he set NCAA all-time records for passing yards and passing touchdowns in Kevin Sumlin's 'Air Raid' offence."He continues to grow, and we're struggling and looking for a spark. I think he deserves an opportunity to go out there," Kubiak told the Texans official website.Vick was forced to sit out the Eagles victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last weekend with a hamstring injury and has not recovered in time for the upcoming clash with the Dallas Cowboys.Back-up quarterback Nick Foles completed 22 of 31 passes for 296 yards and three touchdowns in his absence and will stay behind centre on Sunday.Philadelphia head coach Chip Kelly had not officially ruled Vick out of contention, but the former Atlanta Falcons star says he will not be ready.He said: "I just can't rush it.  came out and tried to push it a little bit, tried to run a little faster. I was able to do that, but at the same time, I don't want to push it too much. I want to let things happen naturally."
