Luke Joeckel: Was taken with the second overall pick in the NFL draft in April of this yearRookie offensive tackle Luke Joeckel is one of three players the winless Jacksonville Jaguars have placed on injured reserve.Joeckel, who was taken with the second pick in the NFL draft in April, suffered a fractured right ankle during the first quarter of the Jaguars' 34-20 loss to the St Louis Rams on Sunday.It was the first game for the 21-year-old on the left side of the line, having been switched from the right to replace fellow tackle Eugene Munroe, who last week was traded to the Baltimore Ravens.Joeckel is expected to undergo surgery on the injury in the near future and will not play again during his debut campaign.The Jaguars will also have to do without safety Dwight Lowery for the rest of the season.The former New York Jet - who was acquired by Jacksonville in a trade in 2011 - suffered a concussion in the week three reverse to the Seattle Seahawks and has not played since.The team also placed tight end Allen Reisner on injured reserve with the designation to return later in the season, meaning he can go back on the active roster after eight weeks.Meanwhile, the Jags have been awarded offensive tackle Sam Young off waivers from the Buffalo Bills to help cover the losses of both Joeckel and Munroe.Elsewhere in the NFL, the Indianapolis Colts have lost Ahmad Bradshaw for the remainder of the season after the running back opted to undergo neck surgery.Bradshaw - an off-season signing in free agency having been released by the New York Giants in a cost-cutting measure - was hurt in the week three 27-7 triumph at the San Francisco 49ers.He becomes the second tail-back the Colts have seen go down for the year - Vick Ballard sustained a knee injury in practice before the week two clash with the Miami Dolphins.
