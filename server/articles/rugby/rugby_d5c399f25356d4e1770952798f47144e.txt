Coverage: Watch England's group matches and Wales v Italy, plus one quarter-final, one semi-final and the final live on BBC TV, online, mobiles and Connected TVs. Listen to every match live on BBC Radio 5 or 5 live sports extra    Forward Tyson Frizell has been passed fit for Wales' World Cup opener with Italy in Cardiff on Saturday.
    His return means Wales will have one Australian NRL player in their squad compared to Italy's 10.
    Coach Iestyn Harris said: "I'm pleased that Tyson has overcome his injury. He, and of course all of the others, have worked hard to be here."
    Italy coach Carlo Napolitano has made three changes from the team that beat England in Saturday's warm up game.
    Chris Centrino, Ben Falcone and Cameron Ciraldo, who were on the bench against England, all come into the starting line up.
    The Welsh squad includes three uncapped players - Warrington's Rhys Evans, Larne Patrick of Huddersfield Giants and Anthony Walker of St Helens.
    Harris added: "I think we have a really strong team for the opening game. We're going into it with confidence but we know that we'll have a tough time against Italy especially after their win over England last week."
