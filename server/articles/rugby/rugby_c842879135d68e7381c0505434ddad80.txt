Wigan's star man Harrison HansenWigan's Harrison Hansen has revealed his delight and pride after becoming the captain of Samoa with the World Cup just a week away.Samoa coach Matt Parish opted to employ the Auckland-born forward when Roy Asotasi withdrew from the squad for personal reasons."Harrison has been outstanding since day one with his attitude and leadership at training and in camp," Parish said."I have no doubt he will inspire the boys to represent their proud nation of Samoa with the honour the Toa jersey commands."Hansen is the longest-serving member of Samoa's World Cup squad, having won his first cap in 2007, and led them for the first time in Saturday's 52-16 defeat by England Knights."It's a huge honour to represent my country of Samoa and my family," the Wigan second rower said."I thank Rugby League Samoa for this incredible opportunity. I look forward to working with this great team and having a strong and successful World Cup."Hansen came off with a dead leg 17 minutes into the match and never returned, but Parish later explained it was merely a precaution ahead of next Sunday's opening World Cup game against holders New Zealand in Warrington.Hansen will celebrate his 28th birthday 24 hours before the clash with the Kiwis.
