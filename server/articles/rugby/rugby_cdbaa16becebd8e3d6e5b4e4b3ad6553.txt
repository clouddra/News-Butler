England lose to Italy on Saturday 

     in a warm-up game they were supposed to stroll would probably have a one-word answer to the above question - no.
    If England cannot beat Italy what hope do they have against tournament favourites Australia, who they play in the opening fixture on Saturday?
    Since 2008, England have played Australia five times, losing all of them and never finishing within 10 points of their opponents - who have quality throughout their side.
    "Cameron Smith, Billy Slater, Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk, Greg Inglis - they have loads of world-class players and we know what is coming," England skipper Kevin Sinfield tells BBC Sport.

    "They seem to have a conveyor belt - when one retires another one just rolls off it."
    Since a 
    
shock defeat on home soil by New Zealand in the 2008 World Cup final, 

     the Kangaroos have won 17 out of 19 fixtures, a draw and a narrow defeat against the Kiwis the only blots on their copybook.
    Australia have won the World Cup nine out of 13 times - and they want their trophy back.
    "They are formidable and they are the team to beat," says England coach Steve McNamara.
    Before losing to Italy, McNamara's team won six fixtures in a row, against Wales, France and an Exiles side made up of some of the best imports in Super League.
    But they have not played either the Kangaroos or New Zealand - the sport's top two international teams - since 2011. When England walk out at the Millennium Stadium to kick off the World Cup, they will be taking a step into the unknown.
