    Hull KR have released prop Evarn Tuimavave on compassionate grounds.
    The 29-year-old 
    
joined the Robins on a two-year deal for the 2013 season 

     but requested an early release to return to his family in the southern hemisphere.
    He made 23 appearances for Craig Sandercock's side, scoring two tries.
    Chief executive Mike Smith said: "On behalf of everyone at the club I'd like to thank him for his contribution during 2013 and wish him all the very best for the future."
