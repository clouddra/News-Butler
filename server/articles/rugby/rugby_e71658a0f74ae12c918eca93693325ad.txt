    England Rugby League head coach Steve McNamara says that the 
    
42-0 win over Ireland 

     has left him with selections headaches ahead of the game with Fiji.
    His side blew Ireland away in the first-half by racing into a 30-point lead in just 24 minutes before the weather hampered their free-scoring form.
    Ryan Hall won the man-of-the-match award after he scored a first half hat-trick as a rampant England ran in a total of eight tries.
