Juan Manuel Leguizamon: New Argentina captainFormer London Irish star Juan Manuel Leguizamon has been appointed as Argentina captain for their autumn tour of Europe.The Pumas take on England at Twickenham on Saturday, followed by Wales and Italy and new coach Daniel Hourcade had to appoint a new skipper because of an injury to Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe, who broke his elbow playing for Toulon in the Top 14.Leguizamon, 30, now at Lyon, said he was delighted to be given the chance to captain the team in what will be his 53rd Test for Argentina."I am very pleased that I have to been given this responsibility and I do my very best," said the back-row forward."We have three very difficult games and we must put in a maximum amount of work each week to tackle them as best we can."Undoubtedly, this appointment is an honour for me as a player and I will seek to continue contributing my bit to help this team to continue to grow, as I have always done."Leguizamon also denied reports of a rift in the Pumas squad that resulted in the resignation of coach Santiago Phelan, insisting the team will be fully united for their appearance at Twickeham."The team is very tight and our objectives are clear. People are talking about that, but we don't care," he said. "Sometimes you have new coaches and you have to adapt yourself to the situation."We are all professional players and we must adapt ourselves as quickly as possible to the new system. There aren't many changes, so that makes things easier for the team."We are playing one of the best teams in the world. We have to be ready for that."England v Argentina is live on Sky Sports 2 on Saturday at 1.30pm
