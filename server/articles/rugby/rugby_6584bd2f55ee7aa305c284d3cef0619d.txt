    Harrison Hansen and Sia Soliola are the only Super League-based players in Samoa's squad for the Rugby League World Cup in England and Wales.
    The pair - of Wigan and St Helens respectively - were both in the 
    
Exiles team that played England 

     in the 2013 international origin match in June.
    Saints duo Francis Meli and Tony Puletua, who played in the last tournament in 2008, both miss out.
    Manly centre Steve Matai is also out after failing to recover from injury.
    The Samoa squad - coached by ex-Salford coach Matt Parish, who is assisted by former St Helens and GB half-back Sean Long - includes two NRL-based players moving to Super League in 2014 - former New Zealand captain Roy Asotasi, who will be joining Warrington and St Helens-bound forward Mose Masoe.
    Former Huddersfield second rower David Fa'alogo, another ex-Kiwi international, is also in the squad.
    Samoa open their Group B campaign against holders New Zealand at Warrington on Sunday, 27 October before facing Papua New Guinea in Hull on Monday, 4 November and travelling to Perpignan a week later to take on France on 11 November.
