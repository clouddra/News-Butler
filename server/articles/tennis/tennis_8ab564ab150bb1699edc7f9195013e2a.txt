    World number one Serena Williams beat Czech fifth seed Petra Kvitova 6-2 6-3 to progress to the semi-finals of the WTA Championships in Istanbul.
    The 32-year-old American advances with a 100% record in the Red Group.

     defeated
         Agnieszka Radwanska

     6-2 6-2 to keep alive her hopes of reaching the last four.
    "Williams only needed to win one set to make sure of her place in the last four, but the thought wouldn't have entered her mind as she knocked the stuffing out of Kvitova. Lethal serving and some meaty and deep returns made the Czech look ineffectual, and she ended with only five games to her name. So can anyone beat Serena? Li Na looks the most likely from the other group, but she has only one success in 10 career meetings with the world number one."
