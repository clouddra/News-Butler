    Victoria Azarenka says Serena Williams can be the "greatest of all time" after the Belarusian lost to the 
    
world number one 7-5 6-7 (6-8) 6-1 in the US Open final 

     at Flushing Meadows. 
    Williams won her fifth US Open title in a thrilling match to repeat 
    
last year's final victory against second seed Azarenka. 

     Williams has now won 17 Grand Slam singles titles, moving her to within one of Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, and seven short of Margaret Court's record total of 24. 
    The American later said she "felt better" after claiming her second Grand Slam title of the year, admitting she "wasn't happy" with her performances overall this season.
