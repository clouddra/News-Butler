David Ferrer: Spaniard faces either Nicolas Almagro or Fabio Fognini in semi-finals of Valencia OpenDefending champion David Ferrer reached the semi-finals of the Valencia Open with a three-set win against fifth seed Jerzy Janowicz.Ferrer came through 6-4 4-6 6-0 in an hour and 40 minutes and will face either fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro or Italy's Fabio Fognini in the last four.He took the opening set after breaking Janowicz's serve for the first time in the tournament but the Pole responded with a solitary break in the second to level the match.Top seed Ferrer dominated the decider without losing a game as his opponent's play became increasingly erratic.Janowicz hit 10 aces and his serve reached speeds of 148mph on the indoor court but it betrayed him at key moments. Two of his four double faults helped cost him two service games and, on match point, he twice fired into the net.The other semi-final will be an all-Russian affair between Mikhail Youzhny and Dmitry Tursunov.Youzhny edged Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 7-5 6-7 (4/7) 6-4 in his quarter-final, while Tursunov secured a more straightforward success, 6-3 6-3 over Frenchman Jeremy Chardy.
