Stanislas Wawrinka: Hopes of reaching ATP World Tour Finals hang in the balanceStanislas Wawrinka saw his hopes of reaching the ATP World Tour Finals in London seriously dented following a shock 6-4 6-3 defeat to Edouard Roger-Vasselin in the first round of the Swiss Indoors.Wawrinka, who has now fallen at the first hurdle of his home event on five occasions, sits eighth in the Race to London but will have to produce a career-best run in the final qualifying event in Paris next week to have a chance of making the end-of-season showpiece.The 28-year-old was well below-par against France's Roger-Vasselin, losing serve once in either set and rarely threatening on return to bow out in just 71 minutes.Wawrinka was not the only first round casualty on Tuesday as second seed Tomas Berdych crashed out in three sets to big-serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic.Czech star Berdych, who should still qualify for the London finale, fell 4-6 7-6 (7/4) 7-6 (7/2) to Karlovic, despite not losing serve, in an epic encounter.Uzbek Denis Istomin booked a second-round meeting with former world number one Roger Federer after beating Argentinian Horacio Zeballos 7-5 7-6 (7/3).Japanese sixth seed Kei Nishikori, losing finalist two years ago to Federer, reached the second round courtesy of a routine 6-2 6-4 win over Marco Chiudinelli, a wildcard entry and childhood friend of Federer.Nishikori next plays Croatian Ivan Dodig, who advanced in just nine minutes as Argentine Carlos Berlocq retired trailing 2-0.Marcos Baghdatis also reached the second round, winning his first match since late September with a defeat of German qualifier Benjamin Becker 7-6 (10/8) 6-1.
