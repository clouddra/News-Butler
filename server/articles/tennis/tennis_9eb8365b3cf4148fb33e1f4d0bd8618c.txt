Heather Watson: Three wins in a row for the first time this yearHeather Watson fought from a set and a break down against third seed Alison Riske to reach the semi-final of the ITF tournament in Poitiers, France.The British No 3 fought back gallantly to beat America's world No 58 3-6 6-4 6-4 and she has now won three times in a row for the first time this year.Watson has now beaten two top-100 players this week after upsetting Riske's fellow American Christina McHale in the first round.Although the ITF tournament is a level below the WTA Tour, it still offers valuable ranking points.At 133rd, Watson is currently well outside the cut-off for automatic entry into the Australian Open in January.But another couple of victories in Poitiers and a good performance in Barnstaple next week could earn a direct spot in Melbourne.In the semi-finals the 21-year-old will play Sweden's Sofia Arvidsson, who defeated second seed Annika Beck 6-2 3-6 7-5.
