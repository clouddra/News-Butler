Richard Gasquet: Frenchman happy with serve during win over Teimuraz GabashviliRichard Gasquet continued his push for a place at the ATP World Tour Finals by reaching the last four of the Kremlin Cup.The Frenchman, who is top seed at the Moscow event, saw off the last Russian left in the draw, Teimuraz Gabashvili, 6-3 6-2 to set up a semi-final date with Croat Ivo Karlovic."I made an early break and it was very important as I was in control after that," said Gasquet."In general I played well. I was a little bit more aggressive than yesterday. I served well and didn't miss much."Gasquet is currently 50 points outside the final qualifying spot for the season-ending tournament in London but, with 250 points available to the Kremlin Cup winner, he still has a chance to catch Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka.Karlovic was a 6-4 6-0 winner against 17-year-old Russian Karen Khachanov, the first time he has won a set to love in his 432 matches on the ATP Tour.Second seed Andreas Seppi will take on Kazakh Mikhail Kukushkin in the other semi-final.Italian Seppi was leading 5-2 in the opening set when Frenchman Edouard Roger-Vasselin, who strained his neck during the warm-up, retired from their quarter-final."From his first service game he couldn't serve normally," said Seppi. "I never like to win like this but sometimes it happens."Kukushkin prevailed 6-4 7-6 (7/4) against his compatriot Andrey Golubev.Meanwhile, in the doubles, Liverpool brothers Ken and Neal Skupski reached their first ATP Tour final together with a 6-3 5-7 10-7 victory over Russians Victor Baluda and Konstantin Kravchuk.
