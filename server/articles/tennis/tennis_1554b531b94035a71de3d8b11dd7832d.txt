    Organisers of the Special Olympics are hoping this week's games will have the same attitude-changing impact as the 2012 Paralympics.
    Matthew Chilvers, 17, a tennis player from Broughton Astley in Leicestershire is amongst those competing. 
    He has recently made the Great Britain squad and this will be his first ever games. 
    The Special Olympics, for people with intellectual disabilities, are being held in Bath and 1,700 athletes are taking part over the four-day event.
