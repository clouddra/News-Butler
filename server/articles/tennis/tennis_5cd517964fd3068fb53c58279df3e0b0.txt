    Cilic, who has dropped to 41st in the world rankings, admitted it had been a difficult period since he tested positive for the prohibited glucose supplement at the Munich Open.
    "I would definitely say it was the worst time of my life to experience this as a player," he said.

    "I knew I didn't cheat and the most important thing was I hadn't taken anybody's prize money and I hadn't beaten anybody in that tournament."
