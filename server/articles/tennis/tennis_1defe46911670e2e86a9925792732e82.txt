    China's Li Na moved into the semi-finals of the WTA Championships for the first time with a 6-2 6-1 victory over Victoria Azarenka in Istanbul.
    World number two Azarenka needed treatment on a back injury at 3-2 down in the opening set and lost the next eight games as Li eased to victory.
    The result means Jelena Jankovic, who still has to play Sara Errani, takes on Serena Williams in the last four.
    Angelique Kerber and Petra Kvitova meet on Friday with the winner facing Li.
