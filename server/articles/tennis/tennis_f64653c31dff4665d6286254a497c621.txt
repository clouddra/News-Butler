    Tennis great John McEnroe says Andy Murray will be "hunted" as the British number one tries to defend his US Open men's singles title.
    With a Wimbledon win also under his belt, Murray's rivals will be "gunning for him", according to McEnroe.
    The four-time US Open champion expects world number one Serena Williams to be "head and shoulders above the rest" in the women's singles.
