Nicolas Almagro: A two-time winner of the Valencia OpenNicolas Almagro made a successful start in his bid for a third title at the Valencia Open with a 6-2 6-3 victory over fellow Spaniard Pablo Andujar.The third-seeded Almagro, who won the title in 2006 and 2007, broke Andujar's serve five times on Tuesday and easily advanced to the second round on the indoor hard court."I have been playing well now after a period when I was a little lost and didn't really know what to do," Almagro said afterwards. "Thanks to the people supporting me I have found my way forward again. I feel strong, but I just need to focus on going match by match."Fellow Spaniards Fernandez Verdasco and Feliciano Lopez both lost in straight sets. Qualifier Michal Przysiezny ousted Verdasco 6-3 7-6 (7/1), while Julien Benneteau thrashed Lopez 6-3 6-1.Sixth-seed Giles Simon was on the receiving end of a 6-1 6-0 mauling at the hands of Colombian Alejandro Falla, but fifth seed Jerzy Janowicz fired down 14 aces to dispense with Pablo Carreno 7-5 7-6 (9/7).Also on Tuesday, Australia's Bernard Tomic was forced to retire during the third set of his match with Mikhail Youzhny and Joao Sousa defeated Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-3 7-5.
