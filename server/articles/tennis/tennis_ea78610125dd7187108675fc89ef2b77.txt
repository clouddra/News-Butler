Heather Watson: Second successive victory in PoitiersHeather Watson continued her form revival with victory over Czech Lucie Hradecka in the ITF tournament in Poitiers.After beating world No 68 Christina McHale in the first round, the British No 3 again came through a tight match to defeat Hradecka 6-1 4-6 6-4.Watson has dropped down from the WTA Tour to the second-tier ITF circuit in a bid to end a very difficult year on a high.She was sidelined for two months by glandular fever earlier this year and until arriving in Poitiers she had won just five matches since, with her ranking plummeting from 39 to 133.In the last eight in France, Watson will meet either American third seed Alison Riske or Canada's Stephanie Dubois.Current British No 2 Johanna Konta lost to Austria's Tamira Paszek on a deciding tie-break having won the second set 6-0.
