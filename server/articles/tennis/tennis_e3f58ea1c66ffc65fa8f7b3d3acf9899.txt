However, following a traumatic day in which he was robbed at Paris's Gare du Nord railway station, Del Potro was just relieved to have won his opening match."I'm so happy to qualify once again here. I have fantastic memories from Wimbledon and the Olympics and I always play well in London," Del Potro said."Richard has an unbelievable backhand and he is a good fighter, but in the end I played solid and won."Hopefully I can beat Novak and Roger. It's going to be really tough, but I don't have anything to lose against them."You can catch all the action from the ATP World Tour Final with a Sky Sports Day Pass. For more information click here
