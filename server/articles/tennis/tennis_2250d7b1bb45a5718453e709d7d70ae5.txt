    Germany's Angelique Kerber has secured the last place at the 
    
WTA Championships   

    in Istanbul - after victory in Linz.
    World number 10 Kerber grabbed the eighth and final spot at the showpiece end-of-season event after winning her quarter-final in Austria on Friday.
    The 25-year-old beat Austria's Patricia Mayr-Achleitner 6-3 6-1 to set up a semi-final clash with fourth-seeded Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro.
    Regardless of the result Kerber will now compete at the WTAs on October 22. 

“"Qualifying for Istanbul is a great achievement."”
    "Qualifying for Istanbul is a great achievement" Kerber said.
    "It's the reward for my consistency though I've had my ups and downs and a couple of injuries this year."
    She saved a break point at 3-2 down in the first set before winning nine straight games to lead 6-3, 5-0.
    The German - who required only one match point - added: "I was a bit nervous at the start and Patricia played really well, then I settled and felt more relaxed."
    America's Sloane Stephens misses out on Istanbul after losing to Switzerland's Stefanie Voegele, 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 7-5
    But Kerber will dine at the top tennis table alongside 
    
Serena Williams 

    , Victoria Azarenka, Agnieska Radwanska, Li Na, Petra Kvitova, Sara Errani and Jelena Jankovic.
    This year the German lost in the final at Monterrey to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and reached the semi-finals at both Indian Wells and Stuttgart - followed by a quarter-final exit in Madrid at the hands of Ana Ivanovic.
