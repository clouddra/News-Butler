Simona Halep is through to another final - this time in SofiaSimona Halep's excellent season continued as she recovered from the loss of the opening set against Ana Ivanovic to reach the final of the Tournament of Champions in Bulgaria.The top-seeded 22-year-old Romanian won 2-6 6-1 6-3 and remains on course to claim her sixth WTA Tour title of the season.The world No 14 has won five tournaments since the start of June and, on Saturday in Sofia, was forced to recover from 0-3 down in the deciding set to see off her Serbian opponent.Halep's big hitting from the baseline proved too much for the former world No 1, who had to concede defeat in 111 minutes after breaking serve twice at the start of the final set.In Sunday's final she will face Sam Stosur, who also needed three sets to fend off the spirited challenge of Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.The Aussie won a topsy-turvy encounter 6-1 1-6 6-3, with the only break of serve of the last set coming in game four.
