Caroline Wozniacki: Had not won a tournament since the Kremlin Cup in Moscow last yearCaroline Wozniacki claimed her first title of 2013 with a 6-2 6-2 victory over Annika Beck in the final of the WTA Luxembourg Open.The 23-year-old made a stuttering start against her German opponent, dropping her first two service games, but then reeled off seven on the spin to take complete charge.Teenager Beck managed to stop the rot but once she lost her serve in the sixth game, her hopes disappeared in a hurry.Wozniacki - the top seed in the tournament - won 11 successive points to seal the 21st title of her career but her first since lifting the Kremlin Cup in Moscow exactly a year ago.The Dane, who lost in the final in Luxembourg back in 2008 to Russian Elena Dementieva, will now head to Istanbul as the first alternate for the BNP Paribas WTA Championships."This result in Luxembourg is going to give me a lot of confidence," she said after beating the world no 57.
