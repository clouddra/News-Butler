Stanislas Wawrinka claims a three-set victory over Tomas Berdych 

     in the opening match of the ATP World Tour Finals.
    Impressive serving helped the Swiss take the first set, but a resurgent Berdych capitalised on Wawrinka's errors in the second-set tie-break.
    However, Wawrinka turned on the style in the decider for a 6-3 6-7 (0-7) 6-3 victory in two hours and 25 minutes at the O2 Arena in London.
