Djokovic wins Paris mastersHowever, some metronomic tennis from Djokovic gave him a window of an opportunity at 4-3, but the Spaniard showed tremendous tenacity to hang on.Ferrer tensed up whilst serving for the set and Djokovic only needed one of his two break point chances to restore parity in what was turning into an intoxicating battle.The 26-year-old Belgrade native turned the screw and opened up two set points on Ferrer's next service game and he took it in 52 minutes of action thanks to a beautifully angled forehand which his opponent netted.Djokovic hit an impressive 18 winners and won 83 per cent of his first serve points while Ferrer won only 29 per cent of his second serve points.French Open runner-up Ferrer was trying to defeat three top 10 players in a row in the ATP rankings since Rome in 2010 and he received an instant boost with a break in the opening game of the second set.But once again nerves got the better of him as he failed to serve out the set after crashing his forehand into the tramlines at 30-40 and from then on Djokovic took over, winning 16 of the final 21 points to reclaim the title he had previously won four years ago.Speaking about the No 1 position after the match, Djokovic said: "It doesn't just depend on me, it depends on Rafa. It's very important for me to concentrate on myself and let things take care of themselves. I've taken a lot of confidence from this week."Watch every session of the ATP World Tour Finals - which run from November 4-11 - on Sky Sports.
