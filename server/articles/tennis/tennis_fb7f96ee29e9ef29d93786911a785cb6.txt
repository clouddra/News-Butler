     Marion Bartoli says she has "pushed her body through the limits" to achieve her dreams upon 
    
announcing her retirement from tennis.
    The 28-year-old Frenchwoman, ranked seventh in the world, said she was taking the decision with immediate effect because of persistent injuries.
    An emotional Bartoli, whose last match was a defeat by Simona Halep at the Western and Southern Open, admits she tried to continue playing but her body cannot cope anymore.
