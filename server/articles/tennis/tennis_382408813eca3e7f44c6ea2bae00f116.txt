Simona Halep: precise groundstrokesIn-form Romanian Simona Halep claimed her fifth title this year with a 7-6 6-2 victory over Samantha Stosur in the final of the Kremlin Cup in Moscow.World No 18 Halep, who has dropped just one set in four final appearances since winning her maiden WTA title in Nurnbergin in June, consistently outrallied the former US Open champion with precise groundstrokes.Stosur, runner-up here last year and champion in Osaka last week, saved 11 break points in the first set before Halep raced through the breaker for the loss of a solitary point.The 22-year-old fifth seed moved into a 4-1 lead in the second set and sealed the victory in an hour and 41 minutes with a break on her first match point, when the seventh-seeded Stosur netted a return."It's an incredible year for me and I am enjoying every moment of it," said Halep, who is projected to break into the top 15 after her latest win."Now I already have all of my thoughts about the Tournament of Champions in Sofia."It's a very special event for me and I'm preparing thoroughly for it and hope to perform there at my top level."
