    Guernsey's Heather Watson has dropped to third in the British rankings, behind both Laura Robson and Johanna Konta, as her poor form continues.
    Watson peaked at 39 in the world in early 2013 but has since endured a miserable season and has now dropped to number 133 in the rankings.
    Robson is still inside the top 50 at 46, while Konta is at 115.
    The 21-year-old has struggled after a 
    
bout of glandular fever, 

     while a change in coach has failed to spark an upturn.
    Her poor run of form continued on Monday with a first-round exit in the Luxembourg Open at the hands of Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer.
    Watson staged a brave recovery after losing the first set in just 24 minutes but the world number 63 came through 6-0 5-7 6-2 in one hour and 42 minutes to give the Briton her eighth defeat in nine matches.
    Her 
    
first-round exit at last week's Japan Open 

     was particularly costly in rankings terms, as 
    
she won the tournament last season.
    Her defeat by Puerto Rico's Monica Puig in Japan saw her plummet from 92nd in the rankings to her current position.
