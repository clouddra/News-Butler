Sam Stosur: Australian extended winning streak to eight matchesSam Stosur ended Ana Ivanovic's hopes of a first WTA Tour title in almost two years at the Kremlin Cup.Seventh seed Stosur saw off fourth seed Ivanovic 7-5 6-4 in their quarter-final at the Moscow event.The Australian, who also beat Ivanovic at this tournament last year, came from 3-0 down to take the opening set and closed out the victory thanks to a solitary break in the second."Probably having won our match here last year, I certainly had a few things in my head that I wanted to try to do today against her," said Stosur, now on a winning streak of eight matches after lifting the Japan Open title last Sunday."Right from the start it was kind of working and from that my confidence kind of built, and I was able to keep going and play well till the end."Stosur will play Svetlana Kuznetsova in the last four after the Russian defeated second seed Roberta Vinci 6-2 6-3.The defeat ended Vinci's hopes of being an alternate for the WTA Championships in Istanbul next week."I played really well in the first set with some slight mistakes in the second, which I managed to overcome," said Kuznetsova."I hope I'll be able to boost my performance in the next matches as well."The other semi-final pits fifth seed Simona Halep against unseeded Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.Romanian Halep was a 6-1 6-1 winner against Russia's Alisa Kleybanova and Pavlyuchenkova beat Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova 6-0 6-4.
