    World number two Andy Murray reflects on 
    
losing a "tough" third-round game 

     in straight sets to Ernests Gulbis at the Rogers Cup in Montreal.
    The 6-4 6-3 loss is the Wimbledon champion's first defeat since May, and came in just under one and a half hours.
    Murray is pleased that his timing is returning and he will play a final tournament in Cincinnati, before beginning the defence of his US Open title in New York title later this month.
