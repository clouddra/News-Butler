Grigor Dimitrov celebrates his maiden victoryBulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov claimed the first ATP Tour title of his career after rallying to shock top seed David Ferrer in the final of the Stockholm Open in Sweden.The 22-year-old recovered from a nightmare first set in which he dropped serve three times, to pull off a 2-6 6-3 6-4 win in two hours and 10 minutes.Dimitrov did not face a single break point in the second set and took advantage on one of his two opportunities on the Spaniard's serve to force a decider.And with world number three Ferrer struggling against Dimitrov's new-found confidence on serve, the Bulgarian secured the crucial break again to wrap up his maiden title in style.Dimitrov, who is the boyfriend of Russian star Maria Sharapova, had never beaten Ferrer in four previous meetings."(It's a) dream come true," said an emotional Dimitrov, who was competing in just his second final."Everyone has always told me how important a step this is."
