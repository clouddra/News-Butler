    Maria Sharapova's former coach Thomas Hogstedt is one of the high-profile names interested in becoming British number one Laura Robson's new mentor.
    The Russian completed a career Grand Slam under the Swede's guidance, adding 
    
the 2012 French Open 

     crown to her US Open, Wimbledon and Australian titles.
    "Robson's ball-striking ability and big-match temperament are a huge attraction to prospective coaches"
    Sharapova, 26, also regained her world number one status with Hogstedt before they split after this year's Wimbledon.
    Robson, 19, recently ended a four-month partnership with Miles Maclagan.
    After a 
    
run to the last 16 at Wimbledon 

     and the 
    
third round of the US Open, 

     Robson has endured a difficult end to the season, collecting only three wins in four events since Flushing Meadows.
    Hogstedt has taken an interest in Robson's career for a while, and is said to have a good relationship with her influential mother Kathy.
    Nigel Sears - the former head coach of women's tennis at the LTA - is another attracted by the challenge.
