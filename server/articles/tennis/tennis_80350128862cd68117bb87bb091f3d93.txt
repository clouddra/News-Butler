Ana Ivanovic: Serb is without a WTA Tour title for almost two yearsFormer French Open champion Ana Ivanovic reached the quarter-finals of the Kremlin Cup with a straight-sets win over Czech Klara Zakopalova.Ivanovic, seeded four at the Moscow event, reeled off the first five games before going on to close out a 6-3 6-1 victory."It wasn't an easy match for me," said Ivanovic, who has not won a WTA Tour title for almost two years."I really started well. But she's a tough player and the second set was much tougher than the scoreline indicates. But I added power in the important moments and was very pleased to win."The Serb will play seventh seed Sam Stosur in the last eight after the Australian extended her winning streak to seven matches with a 6-4 6-1 success against France's Alize Cornet.Stosur, who won her second title of the season in Osaka last Sunday, won five consecutive games to take the first set and go 2-0 up in the second."I did what I had to do," said Stosur, who beat Ivanovic in the Kremlin Cup semi-finals last year."I made her play more balls when I had a chance to attack deep, so overall it was a pretty solid match."Also on Thursday, fifth-seeded Romanian Simona Halep went through when her second-round opponent Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia retired after Halep had taken the opening set 6-2.Rybarikova's compatriot Daniela Hantuchova recovered from a set down to beat Serbia's Vesna Dolonc 3-6 6-4 6-4
