    Andy Murray says he will compete in the Australian Open only if he is "100% fit" following back surgery.
    The Wimbledon champion began his rehabilitation last week after 
    
a disc operation 

     last month.

“The rehab process is pretty tedious and long and I don't want to come back too soon and have to start that process all over again”
    Murray, 26, will miss the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London but wants to be ready for the first Grand Slam of 2014 in Melbourne in January.
    "I hope so, but I'm not going to come back unless I'm 100% fit. I've got a long way to go yet," said the Scot.
    "I've been in the swimming pool and on the bike a little bit but it's still going to be four or five weeks until I'm back on the tennis court hitting some balls. 
    "The rehab process is pretty tedious and long and I don't want to come back too soon and have to start that process all over again. I'll only come back when I'm 100% fit and I hope that's at the beginning of the year."
    Murray, who 
    
received an OBE 

     from Prince William at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, pulled out of the French Open in May because of his back problems.
    The world number four recovered in time to 
    
become Britain's first male Wimbledon singles' champion since 1936.
    His defence of the US Open 
    
ended in the quarter-finals, 

     but he helped Great Britain 
    
beat Croatia in the Davis Cup 

     before surgery.
