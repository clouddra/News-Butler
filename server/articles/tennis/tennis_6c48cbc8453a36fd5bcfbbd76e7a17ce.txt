    Defending US Open champion Andy Murray reflects on a "disappointing" day after he was 
    
knocked out in the quarter-finals 

     by Stanislas Wawrinka.
    Murray, seeded third, failed to earn a single break point in a 6-4 6-3 6-2 defeat by the Swiss.
    The Scot said that despite the loss he was pleased to make the final eight at Flushing Meadows, and that his year as a whole had been a "good one".
