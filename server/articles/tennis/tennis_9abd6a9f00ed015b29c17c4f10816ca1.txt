"In the important moments he's better than me."Ferrer troubled Djokovic early in the match with his deep groundstrokes and hit a backhand drop shot to break for a 3-2 lead. But Djokovic started playing more aggressively and broke back in the 10th game with a forehand winner down the line.The Serb went a set up when Ferrer's forehand sailed long.

Djokovic capitalized on a long forehand from the Spaniard to break back before hitting an ace for a 6-5 lead.Nadal unseated Djokovic atop the rankings by reaching the final of the China Open last month.
