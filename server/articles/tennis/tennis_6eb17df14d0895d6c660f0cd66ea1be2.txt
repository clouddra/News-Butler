Serena Williams: Two wins from two matches in IstanbulSerena Williams continued her dominance over Agnieszka Radwanska as she made it two wins from at the WTA Championships in Istanbul.The American is the only player with a 100% record from two round-robin matches at the Sinan Erdem Dome as she beat Radwanska 6-2 6-4.It means Williams has won all eight of the duo's meetings with the Pole only having managed to take one set off the current world number one in that time.However, the scoreline was harsh on third seed Radwanska, who forced eight break points on the formidable Williams serve but could take only one.Williams' progress from the red group is now all but assured, while Radwanska must beat Angelique Kerber on Thursday and hope other results go her way.Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka's recent slump continued as she lost to Jelena Jankovic - her fourth defeat out of five dating back to the US Open.Jankovic, who showed why she has climbed from outside the top 20 at the start of the season back into the top eight, produced a fine performance to win 6-4 6-3.But she was helped by a string of unforced errors from Azarenka, who fought hard but could not find anything like her best form.The Belarusian said: "Of course she was playing well. I think she's playing her best tennis right now. She's really improved a lot throughout the year."But I cannot sit and say that I played well and she was better today. I let a lot of balls go. There was a lot of mistakes - small mistakes, a little bit bigger mistakes.It was just so inconsistent and it just doesn't work against top players.""I think I have been pretty much the most consistent player the last two years and sometimes things like this happen. It's just the bad road and I have to go through that, because it didn't happen to me in a long, long time."Having beaten Sara Errani in her first match, Azarenka's hopes of making the semi-finals are still very much alive going into her final white group clash against Li Na on Friday.
