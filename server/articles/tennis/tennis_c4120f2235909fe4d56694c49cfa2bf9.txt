LONDON -- Organizers of the Fed Cup have moved the date of the 2014 final back a week to avoid competing with other events.The date of the final clashed with the weeklong WTA Tournament of Champions, a second-tier event to end the year.ITF president Ricci Bitti said in a statement that the calendar change shows "flexibility and concern for the players" and will help them "continue to represent their country in this prestigious competition."The lineup for this year's Fed Cup final, between Italy and Russia starting Saturday in Sardinia, has been weakened by the decision of Russia's highest-ranked players to play in the Tournament of Champions.The 2014 final will be held Nov. 8-9.
