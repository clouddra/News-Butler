"If you'd seen me three years ago, I was really asking myself if it made sense to continue," said Haas, who underwent hip surgery in 2010."I have been paying a lot of attention to my fitness and nutrition and I am always looking to improve my tennis."For Haase, it was a second defeat this season in a final. He'd previously lost in Gstaad, Switzerland, three months ago."I am disappointed as I've had my chances," said Haase, who upset top-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semi-final."When I broke him at 1-0 in the second set, I started to feel stronger. I believed I could turn around the match. But he played all or nothing at the end and that paid off for him."The victory for Haas - the 15th of his career - also kept him in the race for one of the four remaining spots in the eight-man World Tour Finals which take place in London in two weeks' time.He currently lies in a provisional 12th place.
