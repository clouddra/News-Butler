    Colin Fleming and Andy Murray discuss their unexpected doubles partnership following their 
    
appearance in the final of the Rogers Cup in Montreal.
    The British pair lost to Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares in the final after what Fleming describes as an "amazing week" alongside Murray that he hopes will act as a "springboard" for the future.
    Murray stepped in as a last minute replacement for Fleming's regular doubles partner Jonny Marray, who missed out on qualifying for the event through the rankings.
