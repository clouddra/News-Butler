ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Cardinals cleanup hitter Allen Craig says he's recovered from a foot injury and ready to be put on St. Louis' World Series roster.''I'm happy with where I'm at,'' Craig said Sunday. ''No complaints. I'm happy to be on the roster and give it a shot, so I'm really excited.''Craig hasn't played since Sept. 4 because a left mid-foot sprain. He anticipates being the designated hitter in Wednesday night's Series opener at the Boston Red Sox.''I think all indications are pointing that way,'' Craig said. ''I haven't been told, 'Hey, you're on the roster,' but given my progress, I think I'm in a good spot.''It's basically a no-lose proposition because the Cardinals could replace Craig if he re-injured the foot. General manager John Mozeliak said doctors believe Craig is progressed to the point he's not risking a major setback.''He's such a prolific hitter it's definitely worth the chance,'' Mozeliak said. ''My understanding is he's swinging the bat pretty well. If nothing else, he adds a little pop off that bench.''St. Louis worked out at Busch Stadium, two days after beating the Los Angeles Dodgers for the NL pennantCraig hasn't tested the foot on defense yet, but he wouldn't have to play first base until the Series moves to Busch Stadium for Game 3 on Saturday. Craig is wearing an orthotic device in his shoe and said there was ''nothing super-special'' about precautionary measures.Rookie Matt Adams has been the regular first baseman since Craig was hurt while running the bases.Craig batted a major league-best .454 during the regular season with runners in scoring position.''He's another force in that lineup,'' manager Mike Matheny said. ''So, if we can have him we'll be excited.''
