BOSTON (AP) -- Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said Ray Davis will succeed Nolan Ryan as the controlling owner of the Texas Rangers.Ryan, a Hall of Fame pitcher, said Oct. 17 he is resigning effective at the end of the month and will sell his ownership stake to Davis and Bob Simpson, the team's co-chairmen. Major League Baseball requires each team to have a designated control person, and Davis will be approved, likely when MLB owners meet Nov. 14 at Orlando, Fla.''It hasn't been quite determined, but he will be the control person,'' Selig said Thursday before Game 2 of the World Series.Selig refused to discuss the actions by Alex Rodriguez's side as the New York Yankees third baseman tries to persuade arbitrator Fredric Horowitz to overturn his 211-game suspension for violations of baseball's drug agreement and labor contract.''I think at this point it's inappropriate for me to comment, I think for a myriad of reasons that you can probably understand,'' he said.
