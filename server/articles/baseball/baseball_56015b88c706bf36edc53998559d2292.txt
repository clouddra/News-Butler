BOSTON (AP) -- Jake Peavy will start Game 3 of the World Series for the Boston Red Sox instead of Clay Buchholz, who has weakness in his right shoulder.Red Sox manager John Farrell confirmed before Game 2 on Thursday night that he is flipping Peavy and Clay Buchholz for the game when the Series moves to Busch Stadium in St. Louis. Farrell said Buchholz, who last pitched in Game 6 of the AL championship series on Saturday, could use extra time off.''I felt like the overriding thing was an additional day of rest for him,'' Farrell said. ''He's going to go Sunday.''Buchholz gave up five runs in eight innings and two runs in five innings in his ALCS starts against Detroit. Peavy gave up seven runs in three innings in his only ALCS start.Asked before the World Series opener against the Cardinals whether Buchholz had an injury, Farrell said, ''Not to the point of keeping him out of starting.''
