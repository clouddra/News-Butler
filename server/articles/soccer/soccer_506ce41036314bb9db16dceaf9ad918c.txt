Gillingham's interim boss Peter Taylor admits he has mixed feelings after watching his side slip to a 2-1 defeat to Preston.Taylor, who led the Kent club into the Championship 13 years ago, was appointed on Monday after Martin Allen had been sacked.But early second-half goals from Keith Keane and 17-year-old Josh Brownhill consigned Taylor's men to defeat with Danny Kedwell's 76th-minute strike proving a mere consolation despite a late rally from the hosts.And while the former England caretaker-manager admitted there was plenty of work still to do he insists he saw enough from his players to believe the future is bright."There were some good bits and some disappointing bits, which is normal over 90 minutes, but overall I was very pleased," Taylor said."At times we passed the ball well, we created a couple of decent chances and on another day they would have gone in."I asked the players to be more unpredictable when they've got the ball. At times, they did that. We've had three days putting things into them, so in that respect they've done great."I told the players not to drop their heads, because the way we finished we could've got some goals."Fair play to Preston for putting their bodies in the way."It could have been a point, which would have made it a more pleasing evening."It was extremely unlucky that their opener was deflected, I think it was going straight to the goalkeeper."Some of the players will be delighted about how they played, some will learn from things that didn't go so well and that's important."It's nice to be back. I would have loved to have started off with three points and now we need to bounce back."
