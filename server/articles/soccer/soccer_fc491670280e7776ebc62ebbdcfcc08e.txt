Julian Korb and Hamburg's Rafael van der Vaart (r) battle for the ballBorussia Monchengladbach narrowed the gap on third-placed Bayer Leverkusen with their first away win of the season, a 2-0 triumph at Hamburg.Germany international Max Kruse struck twice to earn the Foals all three points which sees them reduce the gap on Leverkusen to six, keeping them on course for a place in the Champions League next season.Hamburg, meanwhile, lost their first game under Bert van Marwijk to see their recent revival suffer a setback.Gladbach employed the tactics which have seen them unbeatable at home this season, but which had provided less joy on their travels.Patiently waiting for their opponents to attack, they were still quick to break when in possession and they had the first chance of the game in the eighth minute when Juan Arango teed up Kruse, but he was unable to get a shot in.Oscar Wendt sent in a cross for Patrick Herrmann, whose header was straight at Rene Adler, but it was a sign that the Foals were getting on top.Midway through the first half they took the lead, with Kruse pouncing on a poor back pass by Lasse Sobiech to take the ball round Adler and score.The game opened up with Hamburg committing more and Herrmann getting the chance to shoot just wide from 25 yards before Rafael van der Vaart tried to lob Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who was alert to the danger and saved.Hamburg enjoyed a good spell after the interval, with Van der Vaart hitting the crossbar with a direct free-kick before Maximilian Beister only just missed the target.They soon realised that Gladbach are at their most dangerous when under pressure, however, and Kruse finished off a break with Raffael crossing to the Germany international, who provided a cool finish to seal victory.There was time for Pierre-Michel Lasogga to hit the post, but it was not Hamburg's day as they were beaten at home by an efficient Gladbach side.
