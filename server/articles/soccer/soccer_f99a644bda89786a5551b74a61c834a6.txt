Keith Hill said Rochdale deserved maximum points despite having to come from behind with two late goals to win 2-1 at Cheltenham.Ian Henderson struck in the 81st minute to make it 1-1 after Troy Brown had opened the scoring for the home side and Henderson won it in the second minute of time added on."We deserved to win the game, there is no question about that and nobody can offer any other opinion other than that," Hill said."We had positive possession , but not enough penetration in the first half and we found ourselves going behind to a set play, but we responded again from the bench by making three changes."That's not to say the lads who were on the pitch hadn't responded by creating opportunities prior to them scoring, but we had nothing to lose."It would have been an injustice if we hadn't got anything out of the game, but I was really pleased with the winning goal"I was pleased with the first half because the opposition were trying to press us and we had to be brave in possession and we were and we showed energy, enthusiasm and bravery in our pursuit of playing our game."Teams watch us and they'll try and upset us, be physical against us, but if we stick to our guns we'll run the opposition into the ground by passing the ball."
