Schalke coach Jens Keller is not currently thinking about discussing a new deal for goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand, who is out of contract at the end of the season.Hildebrand joined Schalke two years ago and recently acknowledged that he was uncertain about his long-term future.Keller has been pleased with the 34-year-old's performances this season, but does not want to be drawn into talking about Hildebrand's prospects at Schalke."Timo Hildebrand does a good job," Keller told Sport-BILD weekly. "He is often at the right place at the right time. He reads the game very well."He was also very solid last season through the second phase of the campaign. He was between our posts when we turned our hopes into facts."Some people are just provoking discussions I really cannot see a point in."We have conceded 17 goals so far this term. I would not blame Timo for any of those 17 goals."I do not need to think about the expiring deal of Timo Hildebrand during a month like October."
