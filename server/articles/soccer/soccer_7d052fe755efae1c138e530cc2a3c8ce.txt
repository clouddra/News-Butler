    Watch some classic Football Focus footage from 1985, when rising star Gary Lineker was interviewed selling fruit and vegetables at his parents' market stall.
    The then-Leicester striker occasionally helped his parents out at Leicester Market, but in the interview he admits it is "too much like hard work" for him.
    Lineker left his boyhood club later that year to move to defending league champions Everton.
