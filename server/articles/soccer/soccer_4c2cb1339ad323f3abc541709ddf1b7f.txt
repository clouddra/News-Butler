Erik Tonne has returned to his native Norway with Sandnes Ulf after bringing to an end his time at Sheffield United.The 22-year-old has spent the last two years in England, having been taken to Bramall Lane back in 2011.He has appeared in Championship and League One fixtures, while a loan spell at York City in 2012 dropped him into the non-league ranks.Tonne was, however, unable to find the game time he craved until linking up with HamKam in March 2013.They agreed an eight-month loan deal with the young winger, but Sheffield United recalled him in order to push through an agreement with Sandnes.The Norwegian outfit are delighted to have acquired Tonne's services and have handed him a two-year contract.Club director Tom Rune Espedal told Stavanger Aftenblad: "We are very pleased to have concluded the transfer and feel it is a good solution for us."Players get a good education in England, but it is also positive that he has got experience from the first division in Norway and is ready to fight for a place in our side."
