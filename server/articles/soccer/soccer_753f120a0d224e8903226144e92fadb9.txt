Wolves will go level on points with Leyton Orient at the top of League One if they can beat Carlisle on Tuesday.Kenny Jackett's side, who are seeking a fourth straight win, travel to Brunton Park for the first time since 1987 and would oust Orient at the summit if they won their game in hand by six clear goals.But the former Millwall boss has urged his side not to get carried away."It's been good but we are a work in progress and still feel we need to keep improving to be the team we want to be," Jackett, whose side has laid on free travel for fans making the 163-mile trip, told the club's official website."We are pleased with where we are and the spirit and commitment of the players and we are always looking to try to improve and do better."In every single game we have been in with a chance of the points and that is a big achievement."We have managed to pick up results and have to keep that going. We can't take anything for granted because even though it was a very good win on Saturday (against Stevenage) it certainly wasn't comfortable for us."Teams are raising their games against us but we have managed to put a good record together."To some degree it is a no-lose game for the opposition here who can go and express themselves and give it everything they have got. That is something that we knew would happen over the course of the season."Right-back Matt Doherty and midfielder Kevin McDonald will again miss out with hamstring injuries but striker Leigh Griffiths is fit and pushing for a recall after illness forced him to start on the bench at the weekend.Lee Miller is back on the sidelines for the Cumbrians, having been sent off on his return from six weeks out with a calf injury. Conor Townsend served a one-game ban of his own and comes back into the reckoning.
