Huddersfield are waiting to find out the extent of a knee injury suffered by Jonathan Hogg on Saturday.The midfielder was forced off during the first half of Town's 2-1 defeat at Wigan, their third loss in four outings.But manager Mark Robins is keeping his fingers crossed that the injury is not serious and he will be available to face Birmingham at the weekend."Hoggy took a kick and I am hoping that is as serious as it gets," Robins told the club website."It looked a nasty one and it will be painful. Hopefully it is nothing serious though."
