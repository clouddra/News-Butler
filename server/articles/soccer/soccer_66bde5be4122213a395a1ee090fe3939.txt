The agent of Porto midfielder Fernando has suggested that his client may play for Portugal.The 26-year-old has played in Portugal for seven years since signing from Vila Nova and is considering making himself available for selection for the national team, despite being born in Brazil."The decision to represent Portugal has nothing to do with not being called up by Brazil," Antonio Araujo told Antena 1."He is a player that everyone knows and respects and would be a good option of the Portuguese manager.""He has a daughter that was born in Portugal. He is very happy for having come here, and is thankful that Portugal's provided everything he has achieved so far."Portugal face Sweden in a 2014 FIFA World Cup play-off clash on the 15th and 19th November.
