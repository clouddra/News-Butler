Pedro Leon celebrates Getafe's second goalGetafe profited from Granada defender Pape Diakhate's first-half dismissal to claim a fourth successive league win and move up to fifth place after a 2-0 success.A Jeison Murillo own goal and Pedro Leon's third strike of the season shortly after half-time sealed a 2-0 win to continue Getafe's flying start.Granada slipped to a fourth home loss in five - they have been goalless in each of those defeats - and their work was cut out for them once Diakhate was sent packing on 31 minutes for his second caution.Granada had spurned the opening chance of the game, Yacine Brahimi shooting wide from six yards, before Diakhate was given his first booking after 12 minutes for a foul on Pablo Sarabia.Michael Pereira fired a long-range effort wide but just as the hosts hoped to build up a head of steam Diakhate saw red.The Senegalese was ruled to have felled Fernandez Borja - a decision that did not go down well with team-mates Roberto and Diego Buonanotte who were cautioned.Granada kept the scoreline goalless into half-time but the game was broken open by a calamitous Murillo own goal after 47 minutes.The defender had the seemingly simple task of hacking clear a low cross into the area, but instead conspired to slice the ball off the wrong side of his foot and past Roberto.Getafe then all but sealed the points seven minutes later with a superb Pedro Leon finish.Sarabia laid the ball off across the top of the 18-yard box and the former Real Madrid man opened his body enough to allow him to side-foot into the far corner.Getafe had chances to add to the lead, with Jaime Gavilan forcing Roberto into a save from long range and Adrian Colunga shooting wide.The visitors had done enough to secure another win though and while Granada pushed for a late consolation, Piti twice tested Miguel Moya, they again went goalless at home.
