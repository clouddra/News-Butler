England manager Roy Hodgson admits he cannot start his World Cup selection plans until after the finals draw in Bahia on December 6.Hodgson will head to Arsenal's home match with Norwich on Saturday as he starts to assess possible squad members for next summer's tournament in Brazil.Friendlies against Chile and Germany in November will give Hodgson the chance to field some of his fringe players, but he will wait to find out England's opponents before drawing up his masterplan."Thoughts are swirling around in my head already but we won't be able to start really serious preparation until after December 6," said Hodgson."There is a lot of time ahead to think about the detailed planning of going to play a tournament in Brazil, which will be very different to preparing for the Euros."I trust in the expertise of the FA to make certain when it comes to the detailed planning we will get it right."England secured a place in Rio with a tense 2-0 win over Poland on Tuesday.Hodgson was glad to deliver qualification in the year that the Football Association marked their 150th anniversary."I am pleased about that," Hodgson said. "It would have been a dampener had this been one of the years when we didn't qualify. It doesn't happen that often, but it has happened."One hundred and fifty years is well worth celebrating and a World Cup in Brazil is something else."
