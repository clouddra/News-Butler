Dagenham boss Wayne Burnett was left bemused by his side's performance in the 2-2 draw at struggling Northampton.Captain Ian Morris popped up to rescue a point for Cobblers at Sixfields where Burnett saw his side come from behind to get their noses in front only to be pegged back in the second half.Brentford's on-loan striker Luke Norris broke the deadlock on his Northampton debut but two goals quickly turned the game in the visitors' favour. Zavon Hines equalised and Rhys Murphy put them in front only for Morris to intervene and ensure the spoils were shared.Burnett said: "It was quite clear that after 25 minutes we looked hopeless. I was just about to make a change when we equalised so what do I know!"Northampton were the better side for half an hour and deserved to be in front. We couldn't retain possession but a piece of magic from Zavon Hines put us back in the game."We were a bit fortunate to go in 2-1 up because they were better than us for most of the first half."Goals change games and suddenly we started to keep the ball and move it around. After we took the lead we looked comfortable but then we switched off for a free-kick and got punished, we need to be better than that."Being in front it was two points dropped, but even though Northampton haven't made the best of starts it's still a difficult place to come and the pleasing thing was that we bounced back from the defeat against Cheltenham."
