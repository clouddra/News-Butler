    Sunderland manager Gus Poyet says that Lee Cattermole's reputation for tough tackling proceeds him and his red card in his
    
 side's 1-0 loss to Hull was undeserved.
    Cattermole and Andrea Dossena were sent off in the first-half but despite their numerical disadvantage the Black Cats lost by just a single Carlos Cuellar own goal.
    Cattermole was dismissed for a foul on Ahmed Elmohamady, the seventh red card of his Premier League career.
