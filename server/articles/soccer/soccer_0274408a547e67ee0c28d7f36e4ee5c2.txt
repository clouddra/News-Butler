    Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho says he is "angry" with his players and "does not understand" why his side 
    
lost 2-0 at Newcastle.
    Yoan Gouffran and Loic Remy scored second-half goals to end Chelsea's run of six straight wins.
    Mourinho believes some of his players prefer playing in their "comfort zone" at home as they produce better performances at Stamford Bridge then they do away.
