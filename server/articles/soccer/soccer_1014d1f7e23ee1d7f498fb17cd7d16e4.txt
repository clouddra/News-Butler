Iker Casillas says comments made regarding his future were not intended as a 'play me or sell me' ultimatum to Real Madrid.Casillas remains an iconic figure at Santiago Bernabeu, with the World Cup winner having spent his entire career to date in the Spanish capital.He is, however, no longer a guaranteed starter at Real, with Diego Lopez having edged to the front of the goalkeeping pecking order.As one of the most high-profile shot-stoppers in world football, and at 32 years of age, Casillas recently hinted that he may have to move on if his situation does not improve.He said: "I have been here since I was a small boy but the day will come when maybe a decision will have to be made."I have decided I want to be part of this squad for a long time but if the situation doesn't change in three months and you ask me the same question, perhaps I will answer that I am planning to leave."While conceding that exit thoughts have crossed his mind, Casillas insists he is not looking for a route out of Real just yet and will not rock the boat in order to get his way.Following a UEFA Champions League outing in a 2-1 victory over Juventus on Wednesday, he said: "When you talk, you talk. My comments weren't meant to offend anyone."I don't want to give anyone an ultimatum. I'm getting used to seeing the name Iker Casillas in the media every day."It is likely that Casillas will be returned to the bench for Saturday's El Clasico clash with Barcelona, but he believes Real will head into that contest in buoyant mood and confident they can pull level with their fiercest rivals at the top of the La Liga table.He added: "What we have to do is know that a win will push us towards first place, but we have to go there with the aim of winning the game."
