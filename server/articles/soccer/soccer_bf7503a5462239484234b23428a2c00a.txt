Striker Adam Rooney earned praise from his manager after inspiring Oldham to a 1-0 victory over Carlisle.Rooney won and converted a 26th-minute penalty to hand the Latics their first win in seven Sky Bet League One games and condemn the Cumbrians to a first defeat in six matches under the guidance of Graham Kavanagh, who was sent to the stands during the second half.Oldham manager Lee Johnson said: "I'm really pleased that Adam Rooney got the winner because he was great up front."He organises, he closes down, he won the penalty and I was always confident that he would stick it away."His form has been a bit indifferent, which he would admit himself, but in the last two games he has been excellent."This is a really big win for us and there were some very good performances from a young group of players."It got a bit tight towards the end, but it's only natural that teams sink back defensively when they are trying to protect a lead."The way we saw out the game was very pleasing. Although they are a young group, they had the maturity to make sure we played the last few minutes in Carlisle's half."It's our first clean sheet in the league this season, so that's obviously something that everybody is pleased about."
