    Stunned Chelsea fans found themselves sitting next to manager Jose Mourinho after the Portuguese was sent off during his side's 
    
4-1 victory over Cardiff.
    Mourinho was ordered from the technical area by referee Anthony Taylor after protesting about apparent time-wasting.
    Chelsea assistant first-team coach Steve Holland said: "Jose was furious on the touchlines.
    "For an hour, we'd been frustrated by their clear time-wasting."
    Mourinho spent the final 20 minutes sitting among supporters behind the Chelsea dug-out, with one fan using Twitter to post a photograph of himself sitting next to the Blues manager.
    Holland added: "Jose is very frustrated. From the first minute, they took a long time to take every dead ball.
