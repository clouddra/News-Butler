Sean O'Driscoll was left infuriated by his Bristol City players after a 2-1 loss to Wycombe in the JPT extended their winless run.Billy Knott and Matt Bloomfield - making his first start in over a year - netted in the first half at Adams Park to put City on the back foot.Brendan Moloney hit a thunderbolt after the break to reduce the deficit but the visitors rarely looked likely to grab an equaliser.O'Driscoll, whose side are also without a win in 10 League One games this season, admitted he expects much more from his players."Sometimes you wonder what goes through players' heads," he said. "We got what we deserved, which is nothing."It was poor, it was pathetic, it was disgraceful - that was the worst performance for me this season."We're not good enough just because we played well on Saturday away at Port Vale to turn up and just go 'it will all happen'. We have got to make sure we do all the basics right and we didn't."You need to get possession to try to do things with it. If you don't get possession you are chasing the game and then we just panicked."What we did in the second half was just boot the ball from back to front. I think there was complacency from everyone."Too many players had poor games. They are professional players - pressure is part and parcel of the game. If they can't play with pressure, they shouldn't be in the profession."It was almost like a training game at times but if it was a training game I would have stopped it after five minutes."
