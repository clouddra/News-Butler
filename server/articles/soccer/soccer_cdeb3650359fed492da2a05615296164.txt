Premier League target Bernard has made it clear to the South American press that he wants to stay at Atletico Mineiro but knows he will have done his job if he does leave after winning the Copa Libertadores.The Brazil international, 20, is reportedly being chased by a number of European clubs including Arsenal, Shakhtar Donetsk and Porto, while Tottenham Hotspur and Borussia Dortmund have previously been credited with an interest.The winger acknowledges that his future is out of his hands and says Mineiro are currently mulling over a number of offers for his services.He is not thinking about a possible move and for the moment would prefer to savour one of the proudest moments of his career, having helped Mineiro beat Paraguayan opponents Olimpia on penalties to be crowned as South American champions."I don't know what can happen with me, but if I leave, I know I will have done my job," he told Sportv."I have said a thousand times that I want to stay, but it doesn't depend on me now."I made it clear that, if I stay or not, I wanted to leave here with an important title. It's up to God to decide if I stay or not, up to God, [Atletico Mineiro's] presidency and the board."Bernard added: "I am very happy and I want to celebrate this title, which is one of the most important ones I will have in my life."I'll keep working until the board decides something about the transfer. There are offers from English football, Shakhtar and Porto."I don't have anything to say about the fans. If I could, I would stay here the rest of my life."
