    Former boss Sven-Goran Eriksson has written off England's chances of winning the World Cup next summer.
    The 65-year-old Swede, now coach of Chinese Super League team Guangzhou R&F, led England to the quarter-finals in 
    
2002 

     and 
    
2006.
    He told BBC Radio 5 live: "I don't believe they can win the World Cup in Brazil. Maybe in Russia in 2018. There are a lot of young players coming in. 

“The quarter-finals would be very good. It is time for a semi-final or final.”
    "I think it's easier to win it there than in Brazil."

Roy Hodgson's side secured qualification 

     for Brazil by winning their group but only find themselves in the second pot of seeds for the 6 December draw for next summer's tournament.
    They will have to make history if they are to repeat their solitary World Cup win of 1966, as no European side have won the competition in South America. 
    FA chairman Greg Dyke has also 
    
played down England's hopes next year 

     and targeted success in the 2022 World Cup.
    Eriksson believes another run to the last eight, matching his own best with England, would not represent failure for Hodgson, whose predecessor Fabio Capello saw his team 
    
beaten by Germany in the second round in 2010.
    He added: "Expectation does not seem to be what it was in the past and I think that's very good for the team.
    "The quarter-finals would be very good. It is time for a semi-final or final."
    However, Eriksson believes a winter break in English football is needed for success.
