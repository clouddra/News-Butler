Former Manchester City director Dennis Tueart has criticised UEFA in the wake of the racism row that erupted following the club's Champions League clash against CSKA Moscow on Wednesday.City midfielder Yaya Toure was unhappy with the alleged racist abuse he was subjected to during the match in the Russian capital.The English Premier League club are to complain to UEFA who are awaiting the report from the match officials before deciding what action -if any - to take.UEFA said in a statement on Thursday: "Once received, the contents of the report will determine whether a disciplinary case be opened. Should this be the case, we will communicate accordingly."And now Tueart, who was relieved of his role as director in 2007 following a takeover of the club, has weighed-in with his views on the incident.The 63-year-old former City player is unhappy that UEFA recently reduced the ban on Lazio following a racist incident involving fans of the Italian club.Tueart told Sky Sports Radio: "It is sad. We thought UEFA were addressing this situation but they went back on the ban they put on Lazio and now they're not closing the stadium for the game."They are just closing part of the stadium. If you are going to put sanctions in place you have to make sure they are implemented."There is an awful lot of work being done as far as keeping racism out of the game. You find it is only a minority of supporters, so minorities have to be targeted, not majorities."UEFA have to make that judgement and it is a difficult one. I know at City, when I was a director, we did an awful lot with the supporters to make the club fully integrated with the community as we have many races in the area."We have done a lot in this country. I would question what other organisations have done in their countries? UEFA need to be a real force behind it, to make sure everyone concurs with what we are trying to do."
