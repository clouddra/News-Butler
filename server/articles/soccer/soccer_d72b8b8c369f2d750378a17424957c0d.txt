Malmo star Jiloan Hamad says he rejected offers from three clubs during the transfer window.Whilst Malmo did sell star striker Tokelo Rantie to Bournemouth before deadline day, he was not followed by Hamad - who says the possible moves on offer for him did not 'feel right'.Reports in Sweden claim that two of the clubs in question were West Ham United and Sochaux."I got three serious offers which I rejected," Hamad told Expressen."I had some options, the offers were good financially. But some clubs did not feel right."I have got a good agent and a good advisor."The 22-year-old is focused on winning the title with Malmo, before he considers his future."There are eight matches left and it does not reduce the chances to move on later on." Hamad added."I have been involved in the build up for Malmo and I do not want to leave unless it is something really special."All I have got on my mind right now is another Swedish championship. I want to win, the squad want to win."I am fully focused on the title, that is my only target right now."
