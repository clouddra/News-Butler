Aberdeen goalkeeper Jamie Langfield is hoping to earn a new contract at Pittodrie and is enjoying his football under Derek McInnes.Langfield has made over 280 appearances for Aberdeen since joining the club in 2005, but he is out of contract at the end of the season.He has conceded just twice in his last 10 games and the 33-year-old, who underwent brain surgery two years ago, is happy with how things are going."This is the most I've enjoyed my football for a long time and I think what happened a couple of years ago put a whole new perspective on things for me," said Langfield.

November 4, 2013, 7:30pm"It's up to the manager to decide whether I get a new contract but I don't want to leave here."I'm definitely a better keeper now. I'm a lot more confident. The mistakes are fewer and it's how I respond to them that matters."Aberdeen face Partick Thistle at home on Monday night and victory would lift McInnes' side back into second spot in the Scottish Premiership.The Dons are also through to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup and Langfield has praised the strength of the current squad.He added: "The squad is brilliant. Under Jimmy Calderwood we had a really strong squad but the current manager has also built a strong squad. We're all together and it's showing on the pitch."
