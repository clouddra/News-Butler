Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels has dismissed reports that he will be joining Barcelona at the end of the season.Speculation had claimed that Hummels would be heading to the Spanish champions and that Dortmund had lined up Freiburg youngster Matthias Ginter as his replacement.Dortmund stated last week that reports claiming Hummels had been given permission to join Barcelona in a near Â£30million deal were 'pure nonsense'.The Germany international, who is under contract at Dortmund until 2017, has also now brushed off the rumours."There is no truth in these stories," Hummels told Sky Deutschland. "Of course, every now and then there are bits of reports. That's the same about other players too."Today, I read about [Ilkay] Gundogan and Thomas Muller going to Barcelona. He went to the city of Barcelona to have dinner. This just happens, and then you are getting linked to a move."Then, there are some people claiming they are in touch with Barcelona. And they tell the media about it."We did experience that back in April. Three days later, this was written in a newspaper."He added of the rumours: "Borussia Dortmund did not know anything, we did not know anything. It's just a story because someone started to care about the rumour."
