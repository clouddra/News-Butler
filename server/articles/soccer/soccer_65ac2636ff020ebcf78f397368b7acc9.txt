Uruguay striker Diego Forlan has denied that he is planning to retire at the end of this season.The Internacional forward has revealed that he was misquoted in a recent interview and has no desire to hang up his boots, despite being on the bench for both club and country."There was a mistake in an interview," he said."I want to make clear that I don't have retirement in mind from football, from my current team and from the Uruguayan national team."Despite having his chances limited this season, 34-year-old Forlan believes he can follow in the footsteps of his father Pablo Forlan, a Uruguay international who retired at the age of 39."I like to play in the same way as I did on the first day of my career," he added."I dream to play until the age of 40, similar to the way my father did. I am going to try and reach that objective."After reaching a century of international caps, it's likely that Forlan will be given the chance to compete in Uruguay's crucial World Cup play-off against Jordan.
