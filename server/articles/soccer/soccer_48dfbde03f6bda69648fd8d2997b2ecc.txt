The agent of Paris Saint Germain midfielder Marco Verratti has brushed aside reports that his client could join Inter Milan in the near future.Media speculation in Italy claimed the 20-year-old could be the first target of new Inter owner Erick Thohir.The Indonesian businessman acquired a 70 per cent stake of the Serie A giants on Tuesday."There is no chance of a move," Verratti's agent Donato Di Campli said to www.fcinternews.it."That is because Verratti is not on the transfer market and hasn't been since he arrived at PSG."They won't sell him. I have never received a call from Inter."If they want him then they would have to contact PSG and not me."Verratti joined the Ligue 1 champions in the summer of 2012 from Pescara in a reported 12million euros deal.The Italian playmaker made 39 appearances for PSG last season and this summer signed a contract extension which ties him to the French champions until June 2018.
