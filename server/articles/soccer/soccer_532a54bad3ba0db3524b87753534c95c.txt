Coverage: BBC Radio Scotland. Live text on BBC Sport website.    Captain Scott Brown is backing Celtic to perform well without him against Ajax in the Champions League.
    The midfielder is serving the second of a three-match European suspension as Celtic aim to repeat last month's 
    
2-1 win over the Dutch side in Glasgow.
    Celtic sit third in Group H on three points, while Ajax have one point.
    "The lads are going to have to go there and try to get goals and I have faith they can do it," Brown told the 
    
club website. Â 
    "It'll be difficult to watch but they've got a great chance.
    "They showed what a good team they are when they played Ajax at Celtic Park.
    "Ajax are renowned for their passing but we still managed to get the ball down. 
    "We know they want to play football. It's great to watch but we can put teams under pressure to make mistakes and it came off really well at home when we pressed them high up the park.
    "We've learned how to do that - get the ball back and keep our shape as well. 
    "In Europe we've been doing really well and that's due to the strikers, midfielders and defenders all working so well together."
    Unbeaten Barcelona lead the way in Group H with seven points from three matches, while AC Milan are on five points.
    Brown will watch from the stands in Amsterdam after 
    
failing with an appeal against an extended suspension 

     for his red-card foul on Neymar during Barcelona's 1-0 success at Celtic Park.
    Ajax sit sixth in the Eredivisie table and have only won one of their last five matches, while Celtic preserved their unbeaten Premiership run with a last-minute equaliser at home to Dundee United on Saturday.
