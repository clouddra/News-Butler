    David Moyes may not get many pages for his autobiography from a routine 
    
Champions League win against Real Sociedad 

     - but it still makes one of the more pleasing chapters in the early part of his own Manchester United story.
    European nights at Old Trafford have become traditional reference points for United's progress and have arguably assumed even greater significance now as Moyes, a novice in this environment, embarks on the job of succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson.
    And yet, as Ferguson dominated the agenda with the release of his autobiography, Moyes was reduced to part of the background scenery in this crucial week 
    
as his predecessor took centre stage.
    Moyes and his players looked like they welcomed the opportunity to turn the spotlight away from United's past under Ferguson and back to the present after an unsatisfactory start to the season.
    It was mission accomplished with the 1-0 win over Sociedad secured courtesy of Inigo Martinez's comical second-minute own goal, sliced in hopelessly following a moment of magic from man-of-the-match Wayne Rooney.
