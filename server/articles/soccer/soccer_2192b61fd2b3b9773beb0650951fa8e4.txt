Alexis Sanchez claims to feel settled at Barcelona and says he is planning a lengthy stay at Camp Nou.The Chilean forward moved to Catalunya in 2011, with Barca winning the race to secure his services from Udinese.Sanchez has caught the eye when offered the opportunity to impress in Spain, but faces intense competition for places.With Barcelona's squad brimming with attack-minded talent, the 24-year-old has often had to accept a supporting role.It has been suggested that a lack of playing time could force Sanchez to seek regular first team football elsewhere, but he insists he is going nowhere any time soon.Sanchez told Le 10 Sport: "I always felt (at home) in Barcelona, with the desire to play 100 per cent every game I fight."Fortunately, I was able to score goals from the beginning of the season. I do not intend to stop there, we must continue to move forward."It is very important for a striker to score, especially when you trust your coach and your team-mates."
