Bradford boss Phil Parkinson has hinted young striker Oliver McBurnie could soon be getting more involvement with the senior squad.McBurnie, who travelled with the Bantams' first team to Crewe on Saturday, has started the season in sensational form for the club's youth side, with 17 goals in 10 league and cup games.The 17-year-old is actually a member of the club's professional ranks after signing a three-year deal back in August.Parkinson told the club's official website: "Ollie McBurnie was with us in the squad for Saturday at Crewe."To get 17 goals for the youth team already - I have to start looking at trying to get him involved with the first-team squad and get him training with us on a more regular basis."That is the way to progress him. I feel he is a good prospect for us."We have players in the squad who haven't been playing for a while and it is probably best for them to move on to get some first-team football elsewhere."As a manager, you have to keep evolving the squad and keep moving forward, and that is what we are trying to do."
