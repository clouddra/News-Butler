Kieran Agard believes he could be the answer to Rotherham's recent goalscoring problems.After a fine start to the season, the Millers are now winless in five League One games and their failure to put away a string of chances has been cited as the main reason for their slump.Agard, a striker by trade, has been deployed on the right by boss Steve Evans, from where he has already weighed in with six goals - the latest coming in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Colchester.Although happy to play anywhere for the team, the 24-year-old would not mind a run out in his favoured position."I am a striker by trade and always like to play up front," he said."But if the gaffer tells me to play on the right, I will do that for the team, which always comes first."The Millers were unbeaten in their opening eight games, but three defeats and two draws have followed. However, Agard expects his side to regain their form soon."We feel we are as good as anyone in this league and can give anyone a game," he added."With the quality of players we have got, we have handled League One quite well and the step-up after winning promotion last season."But, as a team, we feel we should still be doing better."We are optimistic about the quality we have got in the side and while we've had a few setbacks, we'll keep our heads up and keep going."
