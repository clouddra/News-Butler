"I can play at left-back and I can help the team at times. But everyone knows I am not a left-back."Once there are injuries, I’m the first to fill in the gap. Sometimes it’s better if you can play in only one position.""You see that with other players. These guys specialise in one position and they can completely concentrate."Vertonghen’s comments come on the back of recent criticism pointed at Villas-Boas for failing to protect injured goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.
