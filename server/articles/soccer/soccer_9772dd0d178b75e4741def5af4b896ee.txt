    Andros Townsend says his focus is on maintaining his Tottenham first-team place and feels "one or two bad games" might see him dropped.
    The winger admits the goal he scored to put Tottenham on their way to a 
    
2-0 Premier League win 

     at Aston Villa was "a cross".  
    Townsend believes he must "maintain the balance of confidence and arrogance" so not to get "carried away" with the attention his recent England performances have brought.
