Alexandre Lacazette celebrates.Lyon returned to winning ways in Ligue 1 with a 2-0 victory over 10-man Guingamp on Saturday.Alexandre Lacazette and Bafetimbi Gomis scored in two breathless first-half minutes which was enough to seal victory for the home side before Guingamp substitute midfielder Moustapha Diallo was shown a red card shortly after the break.The result moved Lyon up into 11th place while the visitors slipped to ninth, still two points to the good of their Stade de Gerland hosts.Guingamp goalkeeper Guy N'Dy was peppered with a series of chances in the early stages, and after denying Gueida Fofana's 12th-minute effort with an excellent reflex save, he was unable to stop two goals in the next two minutes.The visitors' defence had only just cleared Fofana's strike but they did so poorly, with the ball falling to Lacazette inside the area.The Lyon midfielder unleashed a right-footed rocket from close range to beat the stunned Guingamp keeper, who could only pick the ball out of the back of his net.Guingamp were their own worst enemies again moments later when defender Younousse Sankhare lost the ball to Gomis, who raced to the goal to slot home.N'Dy denied another Fofana strike, this time from 25 yards, just before the break, but things soon went from bad to worse for Guingamp at the start of the second half when Diallo was sent off in the 52nd minute.The midfielder, who had only come on as a second-half substitute, made a swift return off the pitch after he fouled Lyon captain Maxime Gonalons, who was replaced as a result.Despite their one-man disadvantage, Guingamp went close five minutes later when Mustapha Yatabare headed inches wide, while N'Dy pulled out another superb reflex save to deny a Lacazette volley as Lyon were unable to add to their early scores.
