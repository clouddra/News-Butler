Bury's caretaker boss Ronnie Jepson was pleased with debutant Danny Hylton's contribution in a 1-0 loss to Portsmouth.Bondz N'Gala's early goal left the Shakers without a win in seven, but Hylton, signed on loan this week from Rotherham, impressed for the visiting side."You wouldn't have thought Danny hadn't kicked a ball before today," said Jepson who was handed the job on a part-time basis following Kevin Blackwell's sacking on Monday."He is proper a proper throwback striker who has a go and puts his body on the line. He goes about the game in the right manner and is absolutely top draw."I hope he will do well for us and I think he deserved a goal with the amount of effort he put in."You can see the relief of their management team after the game. We deserved something and I couldn't have asked any more from the players."
