Rotherham boss Steve Evans is sick of saying the same things after a last-gasp goal from Colchester denied the Millers victory in a 2-2 draw.The Millers looked on course for a morale-boosting home victory in League One on Saturday after goals from Matt Tubbs and Kieran Agard but they were made to pay for a host of missed chances as Elliot Lee headed home in the sixth minute of injury time.It has been a familiar story as profligacy in front of goal has cost them in games against Peterborough, Tranmere and Leyton Orient and Evans is getting bored of it as his team is now winless in their last five games."I am as down as I have ever been," he said. "We scored two goals at home we should win, but we didn't win."We have had enough chances again, it's like a record player. Every week."And we have a tendency to make an error and it is killing us."I don't want to take positives. Five games is a consistency of something not being right and we know what it is."But what can you do, we come back in training on Monday and go again. But this hurts."
