Charlie I'Anson is seeking further career progress after seeing his gamble to head for Spain pay off at Elche.The 20-year-old defender holds the honour of being the only Englishman currently turning out in La Liga, yet he is a virtual unknown outside of Grimsby.Having been released by the Mariners in 2012, I'Anson took the decision to leave British shores and return to Spain - having previously spent time in Malaga during his youth.Grimsby's loss has been Elche's gain, with I'Anson handed his senior bow in early October for a side that is hoping to consolidate itself back among Spanish football's elite.I'Anson told the Independent: "They (Grimsby) had a budget to keep to, I understand that."It was a big risk (moving to Spain)."In England they look at my height and they don't think I'm going to be able to play as a centre-half. I'm not the tallest (5ft 11in) but it's not just about height - it's about timing, positioning, how you jump."Everyone thinks language is a big problem, but I don't think it is. A lot of coaches over here can speak English. A lot of players over here can speak English. Everyone gets by."While enjoying life in new surroundings, I'Anson is taking nothing for granted and is aware of the need to view the 2013/14 campaign as a stepping stone to bigger and better things in the future.Asked if he has marked dates in his diary for trips to Barcelona and Real Madrid, he said: "No. This season is about learning and next season I want to be first choice. I have a lot of pace. I like to talk a lot on the pitch."
