Brett Holman holds no grudge against former club Aston Villa after agreeing to join UAE's Al Nasr on a free transfer.The 29 year-old moved to Villa last summer from AZ Alkmaar as one of former manager Alex McLeish's signings, but often found himself frustrated on the sidelines after being frozen out of the first-team picture by current boss Paul Lambert.With the 2014 World Cup in Brazil fast approaching, Australia international Holman admits it was a difficult decision to quit Villa, as the club had looked after him well during his one-year stay, but feels he was left with little choice."It is a move that you have to put a lot of thought into," the midfielder told The National."It's a big step. The Premier League is a fantastic competition and I was at a great club, Aston Villa."They treated me really well, but it wasn't meant to be there. I have a lot of ambition and so does this club Al Nasr."
