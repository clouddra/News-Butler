Internacional have ruled out a move for Julio Cesar after the Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper outlined his intention to secure a January transfer.Cesar has not played for QPR this season following the club's relegation from the Premier League and he is currently recovering from a finger operation.The 34-year-old wants to be playing regular first-team football to boost his prospects of being Brazil's No.1 at the World Cup next summer and is willing to listen to offers."God willing I'll move to another team to help Scolari and Parreira as they are helping me a lot," Cesar is quoted by SportTv. "Now, I have to help them."I have not received any offer yet, but considering my situation, everything would be welcome."Brazilian domestic football is very competitive, I would be closer to everything, including criticism. It would be good. But I don't rule out clubs from England and Italy. I'll consider the best offers."Brazilian side Internacional have been linked with a bid, but director of football Luis Cesar Souto de Moura is not currently planning a move for the former Inter Milan keeper.Souto de Moura told Esporte Interativo: "No, we have not sounded him out, we are not trying to get information about him and I don't even know who Julio Cesar's agent is."We have never considered the possibility of signing him. It's just speculation."We won't be a shop window for anyone. We know Julio Cesar is a great goalie, but we also know he will have to have physio until February. He will be fine after that."Imagine bringing in that kind of expensive player, so we pay the costs of his treatment only for him to then play for Brazil's national team. That makes no sense."We understand the player's dilemma, we respect him, but there is nothing."
