     Head-to-head

    •	Burnley have a 50% winning record in league matches against Queens Park Rangers, and a 33% losing proportion; won 15 and lost 10 of 30. 
    •	Rangers have only registered two league victories at Turf Moor; 3-0 in March 1980 and 2-0 in December 2007, both at second league level.  
    •	If four goals feature in this match, it will take the total on display in competitive games between the pair to 100.  
     Burnley

    •	The Clarets defend their two-point lead at the top of the table, and are pursuing a seventh successive league win and their longest string of victories since nine on the spin in November 1991. 
    •	Maximum points would retain Burnley's best start in 116 years, and see Sean Dyche ending his first year in charge on a massive high.  
    •	Burnley have scored first in 11 of their 12 league games, have won all eight matches in which they have scored two or more goals, and have the second best defence in the division with just seven goals shipped. 
     Queens Park Rangers

    •	Rangers defend the only remaining unbeaten league record in all four divisions (W8, D3), and know that a ninth win would see them leapfrogging Burnley and regaining top spot, which they lost on 5 October.  
    •	The Hoops have a superior points-per-game return to the Clarets (QPR 2.45, Burnley 2.42).  
    •	Harry Redknapp's side banked 22 of their 27 points when completing a club record of eight successive clean sheets, and boast the tightest defence in the Football League, but their total of goals conceded this term doubled with the 2-2 draw at Millwall last weekend.
