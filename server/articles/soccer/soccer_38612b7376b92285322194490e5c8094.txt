Reims continued their fine run of recent form with a comfortable 4-2 victory over Bastia at Stade Auguste Delaune which moved them up to fifth in Ligue 1.Nicolas de Preville fired the hosts into the lead and Grzegorz Krychowiak doubled their advantage from the penalty spot before the interval.Romaric pulled a goal back for Bastia shortly after the resumption, but Prince Oniangue and Eliran Atar sealed a straight-forward win for Reims, meaning Wahbi Khazri's late free-kick was mere consolation for the visitors.Marseille escaped with a 1-1 draw at Rennes to end a run of six successive defeats in all competitions.Despite trailing to a goal from Nelson Oliveira, OM hit back soon after with a Jordan Ayew strike.And they held on to that point by the skin of their teeth as Oliveira saw a second-half penalty saved by Steve Mandanda before the goalkeeper made another crucial intervention in stoppage time.Lyon returned to winning ways with a 2-0 victory over 10-man Guingamp.Alexandre Lacazette and Bafetimbi Gomis scored in two breathless first-half minutes which was enough to seal victory for the home side before Guingamp substitute midfielder Moustapha Diallo was shown a red card shortly after the break.Second-half goals from Mathieu Dossevi and Gregory Pujol lifted Valenciennes off the foot of the table as they earned their first win since the opening day of the season 3-1 at fellow strugglers Ajaccio.Ariel Jacobs' men have plummeted down the table since beating Toulouse in their first match, losing eight and drawing twice, although they took a 26th-minute lead through Pujol.Although Rudy Mater's own goal just after the half-hour mark levelled proceedings, Dossevi put the visitors ahead once again in the 67th minute before Pujol scored his second in the closing stages.It was a much-needed win for Valenciennes although the pressure is now mounting on Ajaccio boss Fabrizio Ravanelli following a fourth successive defeat.A stoppage-time penalty from Cedric Mongongu handed Evian their third consecutive win as they beat Toulouse 2-1.Serge Aurier fired Toulouse ahead after a goalless first half but Daniel Wass equalised just nine minutes later and it looked as though the points were going to be shared.But in the second minute of time-added-on, Mongongu was felled inside in the area and he picked himself off the floor to fire past Ali Ahamada and seal the win.Sochaux and St Etienne both had a player sent off as they played out a goalless draw.St Etienne were reduced to 10 men for the second successive week on 27 minutes when Kurt Zouma, who had earlier cleared a Joseph Lopy header off the line, delivered a crunching tackle on Thomas Guerbert.Last-placed Sochaux pushed for a winner until Petrus Boumal was handed his second caution 18 minutes from the end.
