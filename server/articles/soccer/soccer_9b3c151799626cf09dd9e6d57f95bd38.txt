UEFA president Michel Platini has praised Germany as a "strong candidate" following the German Football Association’s (DFB) announcement to bid for the 2024 European Championship, but warned it could jeopardise their hopes of staging the final of the 2020 European Championship.PA PhotosMichel Platini has backed Germany's decision to bid for Euro 2024.DFB president Wolfgang Niersbach revealed the news of the bid at the 41st Ordinary DFB Congress in Nurnberg on Thursday, in which Platini was in attendance.“Germany is a strong candidate,” Platini is quoted as saying by Sueddeutsche Zeitung.The UEFA chief added that a decision as to who will host the tournament is still far away.“Oh dear! I’ve got to take care of the 2016 European Championships, then the 2020 and then it’s time to see where we are with 2024,” he said.The 2024 bid could, however, conflict with Germany’s plans to stage the final of the 2020 European Championship.To celebrate UEFA’s 60th anniversary, Euro 2020 will take place in 13 different countries across Europe for the first and last time.In early September, the DFB decided to name Munich as the German candidate city for the tournament. Like the English Football Association, the DFB has decided to run for the final package -- which includes both semifinals and the final -- as well as the group package.But Platini said: “When you bid for the 2024 European Championship, it could mean that you won’t get any votes for the 2020 final.“But the vote is open. Everyone is free to vote for whomever he wants to vote for. The same applies for France. They have the 2016 European Championship, and this makes it difficult to bid for the 2020 final.”UEFA will make a decision on the host cities for Euro 2020 in September 2014.
