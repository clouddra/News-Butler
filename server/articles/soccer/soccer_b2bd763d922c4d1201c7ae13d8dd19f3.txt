Mark Hughes admits he is struggling to find the right striker combination to get Stoke firing and climbing up the table.Stoke head to face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday with the worst scoring record in the Premier League.City have managed just four goals in their eight league matches and have drawn four blanks in their last five games with no recognised striker finding the net."I have looked at a number of combinations," said Hughes."Peter Crouch has had a run of games, so too Kenwyne Jones and Marko Arnautovic has played up top as well."It is a question of settling on one combination we feel works for us and will carry us through the vast majority of the season."At the moment we have not quite found it."Despite the problems up front Hughes remains confident that goals will come soon and all the current problems will be forgotten."It is a confidence thing," he said."That goes hand in hand with your strikers when they are not scoring."Sometimes you need a bit of luck, something to fly off your ear."Once you get one you are off and running."The key to it is that you continue to work and do the right things in training."At some point things will change for you and the team. Once they get off andrunning they will be fine."There could be no better place to break the cycle than Old Trafford, where Stoke have such an abysmal record.They have lost on their last 10 visits and not recorded a win there since Alan Bloor scored the only goal in April 1976.
