Fenerbahce coach Ersun Yanal has admitted to holding an interest in Paris St Germain playmaker Javier Pastore.The Argentina international has struggled to produce his best in France since becoming one of the first arrivals under PSG's ambitious Qatari owners.He has been a regular throughout his two seasons with the club, helping them to the Ligue 1 title in 2012/13, but has often seen his future called into question.Liverpool have been credited with holding an interest in the 24-year-old, while AC Milan are believed to be keen on returning the former Palermo forward to Serie A.Fenerbahce are, however, prepared to make the first move in an effort to put a deal in place.Yanal told Turkish daily Fotomac: "I asked to arrange an appointment in Paris to discuss the direction of PSG."Fenerbahce want to move forward with a real number 10."
