    Fulham's Sascha Riether has become the first player to be charged under a new retrospective action scheme.
    The defender, 30, appeared to stamp on Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj in 
    
Fulham's 3-1 loss, 

     but match officials did not see the incident.
    Under the new rules, a three-man panel of former elite referees looked at the incident and advised Reither committed an act of violent conduct.
    Riether has until 1800 GMT on 5 November to respond to the charge.
    Previously retrospective action could previously only be taken when one of the officials had seen it or in exceptional circumstances.
    But the new scheme was introduced after Wigan's Callum McManaman escaped punishment for a dangerous tackle on Newcastle defender Massadio Haidara last season.
    "For an FA charge to follow all three panel members must agree it is a sending-off offence," the FA said. "In this instance, the panel were of the unanimous decision that it was an act of violent conduct."
Massadio Haidara said the decision not to punish Callum McManaman for this challenge last season was "ridiculous"
