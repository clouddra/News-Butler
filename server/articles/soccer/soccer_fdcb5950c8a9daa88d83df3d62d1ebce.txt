Andros Townsend is determined to keep his feet on the ground after scoring in Tottenham Hotspur's 2-0 away win over Aston Villa.The winger scored on his England debut against Montenegro last week before also impressing in the decisive World Cup qualifying win over Poland on Tuesday.He was rewarded with a new four-year contract by Spurs on Friday and set his side on their way to three points at Villa Park when his cross curled inside the post on 31 minutes.Townsend was not taking any credit for the goal and he is anxious not to get carried away after an unforgettable last couple of weeks."It's been one of the best few weeks of my life," Townsend told Sky Sports. "But the main thing today was getting back to winning ways after the result against West Ham.




"The main thing for me now is to not get carried away, to keep my feet on the ground and keep putting in the performances when I get the chance for Spurs."

We got stuck in and got three points."I think we didn't have the best of first halves. Aston Villa defended well and got men behind the ball, but then we got the goal."It was a cross and I'm not going to take credit for it, but I've been unlucky in the past, so I'll take that and it set us on the way to a great three points."The goal was Townsend's first in the Premier League for Spurs and he added: "Obviously, scoring for my country on my debut was one of the highlights of my career, but getting my first goal for my hometown club in the Premier League is up there.

Every time I picked up the ball there were a couple of people around me and I ended up turning over the ball a couple of times."In the second half, they had to go for it a bit and the game opened up. I'm at my best counter-attacking and I think I was happy with my second-half performance in the end."
