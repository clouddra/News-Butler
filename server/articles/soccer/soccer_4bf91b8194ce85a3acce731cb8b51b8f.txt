Zlatan Ibrahimovic: Struggling with a knee injuryParis Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc has warned his team he will accept nothing less than a win against Bastia on Saturday - despite the absence of several big names.The defending champions are unbeaten in Ligue 1 so far this season and sit behind leaders Monaco on goal difference only.However, their home form has been a source of some disappointment for Blanc with two wins and two draws so far, and their cause will not be helped this weekend by injuries and suspensions.Yet Blanc has reminded his players that even a weakened squad should be strong enough to overcome Bastia."We are not the only team to have to deal with injured and suspended players, so do not look for excuses," he told a press conference."We have a competitive team and players at a level to replace those who are missing."We should get three points from every home match. We will face this Bastia team and put them in trouble by imposing our game. That will thwart their plan and force them to defend."Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta are both suspended for the home side while Thiago Silva remains sidelined with a hamstring injury.There are also doubts over the fitness of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Salvatore Sirigu, who are bothered by knee trouble.Bastia will arrive at the Parc des Princes in high spirits following a 4-1 hammering of Lorient in their last match before the international break.And coach Frederic Hantz wants his team to go out and give it their best against their more illustrious opponents."We're going to be careful given the quality of the Paris team," said Hantz. "But we'll still also have the desire to put on a show."You have to give yourself the chance to spring a surprise. We know it'll be very difficult."The Corsican club are without the injured Sebastien Squillaci (Achilles) and suspended Drissa Diakite, although goalkeeper Mickael Landreau has been declared fit following a thigh injury.
