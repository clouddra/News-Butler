Celtic boss Neil Lennon is confident sidelined duo Kris Commons and Georgios Samaras will be fit to face Ajax on Wednesday.Commons has been out for two weeks with a hamstring injury while Samaras missed Saturday's 1-1 draw with Dundee United after receiving a deep cut in his knee at Partick Thistle last weekend.Both have shaken off the injuries and should start the Group H clash in Amsterdam, along with Beram Kayal, Mikael Lustig and Teemu Pukki who were among the substitutes on Saturday."Kris was 50/50 and Sammy was getting stitches out so wouldn't have made it. But they will both be fit for Wednesday," said Lennon.And the Irishman admits his side's inability to cash in on chances is becoming increasingly more of a concern ahead of the showdown with the Dutch champions.Not for the first time this season Celtic squandered a host of opportunities against Jackie McNamara's side and Lennon insists they have to be more clinical in front of goal."Against Dundee United we had 20 attempts at goal, 10 corners, and we have to do better," he said."We keep flashing balls in the box and I always see an opposition defendergetting there first, that's something we need to do better. We need to be braverin the final third."It's a concern. You keep giving teams encouragement. Dundee United scored avery good goal but didn't create much else. The goal gave them something to hang on to. But the amount of chances going begging was frustrating."We don't expect to score in injury time but we always hope. There's a great character about the team even when they're not anywhere near their best."
