Aberdeen striker Scott Vernon says he is hoping that his recent goalscoring exploits can help him to secure a new contract at Pittodrie.The 29-year old endured a frustrating last season, only finding the net on three occasions, before falling out of favour and subsequently down the pecking order in the opening stages of the current Scottish Premiership campaign.However, with four goals in two games at the end of September, Vernon has staked his claim for a spot in Derek McInnes' side, and he says he is now aiming for a new deal."I am out of contract at the end of the season. It's early days but it is lingering at the back of my mind. I just need to keep working hard to try to win a new deal," he told the Daily Record.Vernon also spoke of the difficulties he faced last season, putting his dip in goalscoring form down to being played out of position."I'd like to say it didn't affect me but subconsciously there might have been a bit of that when I was in midfield. You want to be playing in your regular position and scoring," he said."I am no different to any striker - I thrive on confidence. A striker getting goals is a lot better than one not scoring but I feel a lot better in recent weeks after finding the net a few times."Scoring goals helps put you in the frame. I have managed to grab a few recently to put myself in the mix to get a regular game."It was disappointing to not get more time on the pitch earlier in the season but hopefully I have done enough to get a chance to prove myself."
