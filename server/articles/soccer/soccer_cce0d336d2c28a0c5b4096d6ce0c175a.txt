Netherlands Under 21 international goalkeeper Warner Hahn is not surprised he is attracting interest from other clubs, but has not received any contact from Celtic.Hahn currently plays in the Dutch Eerste Divisie with FC Dordrecht, but he is out of contract at the end of the season.Reports in Holland have claimed that Scottish champions Celtic, along with Eredivisie trio Feyenoord, NAC Breda and Roda JC Kerkrade, have shown an interest.The 21-year-old believes his form has warranted the attention of other clubs, but does not know if he is a target for Celtic."It's logical because I am in good form right now," Hahn told Dutch TV NOS regarding the reported interest."I have also read that Celtic are following me, but I haven't heard anything from that club so far."Hahn's agent Revien Kanhai is aware of interest in the 6ft 6in keeper, but insists it is premature to suggest a deal is close to being agreed.Kanhai told Algemeen Dagblad: "There are several clubs who have let it be known they are interested, but any news that a deal is almost done is very premature."
