Lazio sporting director Igli Tare believes Hernanes is happy at the club and has insisted he will not be going anywhere in the near future.The Brazilian midfielder has been an important player for Lazio since his arrival from Sao Paulo in 2010 but has not been at his best so far this season.He was linked with a move to Paris St Germain in the summer window but a transfer did not materialise and Tare says there has never been a reason to question the player's commitment.Tare admits that it would be wrong to rule out the possibility of Hernanes ever leaving Lazio, but is adamant that he will be continuing his career in Rome for some time to come."Despite his inconsistency, Hernanes remains a fundamental player for us," Tare told Corriere dello Sport. "You just have to think back to the goals he has scored."Every time that I have spoken to him or his agent, I have been given the impression that he sees this as his home."He knows what Lazio can give him, what he can have in Rome. It is vital for us that we can guarantee him an important team."You never know what will happen in life and one day he could move somewhere else, but that day is still a long way off."
