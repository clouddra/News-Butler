David Moyes insists Javier Hernandez remains part of his plans after the striker's future at Manchester United was called into question.Hernandez appeared to endorse comments on Twitter made by his Mexico striker partner Carlos Vela, who suggested he should quit United for more regular first-team football.The former Guadalajara forward has made only one Premier League start this term and despite scoring three times in the two games prior to Saturday's top-flight win at Fulham, he was an unused substitute for the clash at Craven Cottage.Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie are on a hot run of form in the United attack but Moyes, speaking ahead of United's Champions League clash with Vela's Real Sociedad, shrugged off suggestions Hernandez might be moved on."We need Javier Hernandez; he's very good for us," Moyes said.




"We need Javier Hernandez; he's very good for us. He's scored a lot of goals over the last few years and continues to do so, so we'll continue to use him."
