Sky Bet have suspended betting on the next Republic of Ireland manager after Martin O'Neill was backed at as short as 1/20 for the vacant post.The former Sunderland boss had shared favouritism with Mick McCarthy over the last few weeks but attracted a surge of interest on Friday morning, with his price plummeting amid a flurry of significant bets.The FAI has been searching for a new boss following Giovanni Trapattoni's departure, but media reports are now suggesting their new man could be in place early next week.Sky Bet Football Trader Chris Spicer said: "Having held a fairly balanced book on the next Republic of Ireland manager, we suddenly saw a surge of bets on O'Neill getting the post on Friday morning."Regardless of how much we shortened our odds the money kept coming, so we have been forced to suspend the market."
