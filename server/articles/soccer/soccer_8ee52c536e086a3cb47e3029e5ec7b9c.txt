    Arsene Wenger describes 
    
Arsenal's 2-0 win over Liverpool 

      as a "great and convincing" performance as the victory moves the Gunners five points clear at the top of the Premier League table.
    Santi Cazorla fired the home side ahead when his first-half header came off the post and Aaron Ramsey's stunning effort helped see off third-placed Liverpool. 
    Wenger's side have now taken 25 points out of the last available 27, and the Gunners boss says this result will "improve the confidence level" among the team.
