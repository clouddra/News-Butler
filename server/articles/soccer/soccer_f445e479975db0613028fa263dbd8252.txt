Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has urged UEFA to take appropriate action against CSKA Moscow after their supporters racially abused Yaya Toure in Wednesday’s Champions League game.

Pellegrini leapt to the defence of Toure, 30, stating he acted in the right way after raising the issue with Romanian referee Ovidiu Hategan.
UEFA is set to investigate the incident, but CSKA have denied that any racial abuse took place, insisting that the Ivory Coast international was alone in hearing anything.

But Pellegrini said: “I think Yaya did the right thing to say what happened. I have talked with Yaya.”

This week, UEFA has been trying to stamp out racism, and Toure was wearing an armband which read ‘say no to racism’ on Wednesday.

And Pellegrini believes UEFA has to back up their campaign by taking action against CSKA.

He added: “I suppose UEFA is doing a special campaign against racism. I think they should do the right things for the future so there is not a repeat, but I don’t know what they are going to do [now].”

Pellegrini was asked if he would support Toure if he were to react to racist abuse in the future by walking off the pitch.

He replied: “I hope it will not happen in the future.”
