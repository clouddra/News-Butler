New Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough 

     tells BBC Look North the club needs stability and hopes he will be given time to turn things around. 
    The former Derby boss, who has replaced David Weir, is the seventh managerial appointment at Bramall Lane since May 2007. 
    Clough's first game in charge of the Blades is at home to Crewe on Saturday.
