    Mark Chapman asks MOTD 2 Extra pundits Dion Dublin, Guy Mowbray and Andy Dunn, whether the 'fear factor' no longer exists for visiting teams at Old Trafford following Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.
    Journalist Dunn says players and managers are "physically lifted" by the fact Ferguson is not in the dugout for Manchester United.
    Former United striker Dublin adds that previously teams could lose a game "before getting off the coach", at Old Trafford, but that was not currently the case.
