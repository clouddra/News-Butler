    Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino says his team "fully deserved" to take a point away from Old Trafford following their 
    
1-1 draw against Manchester United.
    The Saints grabbed a late leveller through Adam Lallana after Robin Van Persie had put the hosts ahead in the first half.
    The result means Southampton are only five points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal.
