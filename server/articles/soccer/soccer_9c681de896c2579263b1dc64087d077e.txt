Didier Digard challenges Bordeaux's Henri SaivetBordeaux continued their impressive recent form with a hard-fought 2-1 win at Nice on Sunday.Goals from Gregory Sertic and Ludovic Obraniak either side of half-time put the visitors in control before Dario Cvitanich scored for Nice with a penalty.But Les Girondins held on - their third straight win in all competitions.Bordeaux have now won four and drawn one of their last five, having previously won just once all season in a hopeless start to the campaign.The away side started brightly on Sunday, with Julien Faubert making ground down the right and crossing for Jussie, who brought the ball under control before attempting an overhead kick which was blocked by goalkeeper David Ospina.Nice almost went in front minutes later, though, Mathieu Bodmer's scissor kick following Ludovic Sane's poor clearance coming back off a post.Bordeaux went in front in the 30th minute following a flowing move.Lucas Orban started it off by releasing Jussie down the left. The Brazilian raced toward goal, skipping past Nemanja Pejcinovic and crossing low for Sertic to rifle a fine shot into the corner corner from the edge of the area.Sertic almost got an even more spectacular second on the stroke of half-time, but his powerful effort from 30 yards was dealt with by Ospina.The Nice goalkeeper had to go off with a knee injury five minutes into the second half, Anthony Mandrea coming on in his place.And the new man had little time to settle into the match as Sertic's free-kick into the area was headed just off target by Henri Saivet.Obraniak doubled the visitors' lead in the 58th minute, Saivet flicking the ball into the path of his team-mate, who took time to assess his options before curling a left-footed effort just under the bar.Nice looked down and out, but they got a lifeline through Cvitanich's 76th-minute penalty.He slid the spot-kick low to the right, sending Cedric Carrasso the wrong way, after Lucas Orban had fouled Alexy Bosetti.Eric Bautheac almost snatched an equaliser in stoppage time, but, unmarked at the far post from Gregoire Puel's ball in, he cut his shot inches wide.At the other end Mandrea made an excellent save to keep out Saivet's fierce shot which looked bound for the top corner, but Bordeaux had already done enough.
