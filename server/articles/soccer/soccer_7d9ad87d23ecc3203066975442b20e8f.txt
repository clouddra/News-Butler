Cedric Bakambu has a shot savedSochaux and St Etienne both had a player sent off as they played out a goalless draw.St Etienne were reduced to 10 men for the second successive week on 27 minutes when Kurt Zouma, who had earlier cleared a Joseph Lopy header off the line, delivered a crunching tackle on Thomas Guerbert.Last-placed Sochaux pushed for a winner until Petrus Boumal was handed his second caution 18 minutes from the end.The hosts defied their lowly status to dominate the game even before Zouma's early dismissal.St Etienne goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier made a superb double save on 18 minutes.Sebastien Corchia combined with Cedric Bakambu at the top of the area before forcing Ruffier to punch clear. The ASSE goalkeeper's work was not done though as Bakumbu ran onto the loose ball only to be denied.A minute later ASSE were riding their luck again as Bakumbu delivered a corner into the area that Lopy met with a header that Zouma was well placed to hack away off the line.Zouma's night ended early though when his clumsy, if unintentional, challenge on Guerbert deservedly saw red.Guerbert was left writhing in pain on the ground and had to be replaced after suffering a nasty looking ankle injury.Sochaux were unable to find the opening goal before the break with Ruffier again making a stunning save in injury-time to keep out Bakambu after he ran onto a Roy Contout pass.The home side continued to press for a goal after the break and Edouard Butin shot inches wide after Roudet's knockdown.Sochaux's hopes of a much-needed win were setback though when Boumal saw yellow for the second time for a tackle on Benjamin Corgnet.ASSE could have stolen the points late on with an unmarked Corgnet shooting straight at the goalkeeper before Brandao's first-time effort flew just wide.
