    West Ham midfielder Joe Cole says England's young talent could see Roy Hodgson's side shine at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
    The 31-year-old, who won 56 caps for the national side, also believes that youth coaches are undervalued in England compared to their European counterparts.
    Cole has been sidelined by a hamstring injury but could return against Manchester City on Saturday.
