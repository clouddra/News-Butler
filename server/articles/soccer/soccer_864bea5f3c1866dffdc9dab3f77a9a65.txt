Nathan Eccleston has returned to Blackpool after Carlisle opted not to extend his loan deal.The 22-year-old striker has spent the last month at Brunton Park, making three appearances, but boss Graham Kavanagh does not see him as part of his immediate plans as his side battle a poor start to the League One season.Kavanagh told the club's official website: "With the results we were getting during the period of his loan it was difficult to get him into the team in the position we would have liked."He is a great lad who came here and worked extremely hard in training and in the games he was involved with."He's a good player and we wish well with his career as he goes on from here."
