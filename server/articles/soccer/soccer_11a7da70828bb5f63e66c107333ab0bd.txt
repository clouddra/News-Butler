Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey has extended his loan spell with Yeovil by another three weeks. The 26-year-old has made 10 appearances since joining the Glovers in August. He earned a recall to the Wales side on the back of a string of impressive performances.Hennessey's loan was set to expire after Saturday's home clash with Nottingham Forest but he will now remain at Huish Park until November 17, although Wolves do have a 24-hour recall option.
