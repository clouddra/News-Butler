Crawley boss Richie Barker has declared his delight having captured Doncaster midfielder Kyle Bennett on a month-long loan deal.The 23-year-old began his career at Wolves before joining Bury in August 2010. He earned a move to Doncaster the following summer and played a key role as Rovers won the League One title last term.Bennett has been limited to just two substitute appearances in the Championship this term and has moved out in search of first-team football, with Crawley boasting an option to extend his loan stay further.Barker told Town's official website: "Kyle is a player I knew from my time at Bury and when he got his move to Doncaster I monitored his progress."He was a big part of what they achieved last season but he hasn't played too many games so far this season and we are delighted Doncaster have agreed to let us have him, initially for a month."Bennett is set to make his Crawley debut away at Stevenage on Saturday.
