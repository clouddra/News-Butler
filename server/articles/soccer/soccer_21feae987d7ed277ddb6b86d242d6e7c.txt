    Dan Walker is joined in the studio by Robbie Fowler and Mark Lawrenson for the latest Football Focus Forum, where they discuss Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart.
    Speaking before 
    
City's 7-0 win over Norwich, 

     both pundits said they believe Hart will come back stronger 
    
after being dropped by Manuel Pellegrini.
    Both Fowler and Lawrenson agree it also makes sense not to play Hart in England's upcoming friendlies against Chile and Germany.
