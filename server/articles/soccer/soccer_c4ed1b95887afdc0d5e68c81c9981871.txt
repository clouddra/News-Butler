Pele has dismissed suggestions that the 2014 World Cup should not be held in Brazil because of their economic problems.This year's Confederations Cup was marred by protests over the cost of staging next summer's tournament, while five of the 12 stadiums are still under construction.However, Pele told Weekend Warm -Up that the staging of major events such as the World Cup and Olympics will help boost Brazil's economy.The three-time World Cup winner said: "I think this is the moment for Brazil to grow. This is the moment to bring the tourists to the country."Brazil has now three excellent events; you have the Confederations Cup, you have the World Cup and then you're going to have the Olympics. I think this is important for the country."This is the moment to really show the country and to make promotion and to grow as a country. We cannot miss this moment."Unfortunately before the Confederations Cup we had a little problem there, political problems, but I hope the World Cup and the Olympics will be clean."Pele, who won 92 caps and scored 77 goals for Brazil, says the country is counting down the days until the World Cup."It is very important for us," said the 73-year-old. "We live football and for me it is a special moment because everybody knows my history."I was eight or nine years old in the 1950s when Brazil hosted the World Cup. I was with my father listening because at that time we did not have TV. I was listening when Brazil lost the World Cup (to Uruguay)."Now we have an opportunity to recover that and it is a very important moment for us."Pele will be talking about the World Cup, Neymar, Wayne Rooney and much more on tonight's Weekend Warm Up. Other guests include Alex McLeish and Jack Wilshere. Tune into Sky Sports News from 6pm.
