Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes has hinted that he would be interested in a move to Monaco.Monaco have been strongly linked with a move for Valdes on a free transfer next summer, when his contract expires at Barcelona.Valdes has so far rejected all overtures from Barca to extend his contract, with the 31-year-old thought to be keen on trying his luck in a new league.A host of Europe's top clubs are believed to be weighing up moves for Valdes, but the Spanish international has indicated he would open to a switch to France and to big-spending Monaco to be reunited with former Barca team-mate Eric Abidal."Ligue 1 attracts me a lot - Monaco or elsewhere in France," Valdes told Telefoot."This is one of my options. [My future] is in the hands of my representatives. But Monaco is a good option.

"This is one of my options. [My future] is in the hands of my representatives. But Monaco is a good option."Victor Valdes"I know that Abidal is very happy at Monaco and I am good friends with him. I consider him a brother."He is an example as a human being. To go back and play at his side again could be very special."Valdes believes the time is right to leave Barcelona after spending his entire career with the Catalan outfit - and he wants to experience a new challenge elsewhere.Valdes has made more than 500 appearances for Barcelona to date, winning six league titles and three Champions League trophies in the process, but stressed that the time was right to move on."I have a contract until the end of the season," added Valdes."I spent over 20 years at the club. I had the chance to win everything, but now my adventure at the club ends. It is time for me to find new goals and  find a new destination."
