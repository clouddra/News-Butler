Paul Cox admitted he would have liked to have seen more from Mansfield once Torquay went down to 10 men in their 0-0 draw.Wales Under 21 winger Billy Bodin - instantly recalled after international duty - came closest to breaking the deadlock for the Gulls with a shot from 20 yards that came back off the foot of the post.United were reduced to 10 men in the 69th minute when central defender Krystian Pearce received a second caution for hauling down Mansfield attacker Sam Clucas.Nevertheless Mansfield found home keeper Martin Rice, who had earlier denied centre forward Matt Rhead, in fine form. Rice made a superb full-length stop to keep out substitute Ben Hutchinson's 30-yard try as the visitors pressed for a winner.Cox said: "The lads are a little bit down because we ground out the first 60 minutes and then they had a man sent off."We did all we could to be positive, put two wingers on and two centre forwards, but we couldn't get that final tap-in."There were a few that flashed across the area that we missed at the far post. We need to be a bit more patient when teams go down to 10 men and take our chances when they arrive."We couldn't have done anymore. We need to put the ball in the back of the net and we were a bit erratic in and around their goal. We have not got any divine right to come to anywhere and expect to win."The positives are we have taken a point away from home but when a team goes down to 10 men you want to play more on the front foot and create a few more chances."It's a decent point away from home and a clean sheet, but we could have done a little bit better."We have had a half decent start to the season and we need to keep improving."
