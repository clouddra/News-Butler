Andre Wisdom: Liverpool loanee set for Derby debutDerby will be able to call on Andre Wisdom for Saturday's Sky Bet Championship clash with Birmingham at Pride Park.Wisdom, who can play at right-back or as a centre-half, joined the Rams this week on loan from Liverpool and could make his debut for the club.Defender Zak Whitbread was withdrawn with a calf complaint against Watford last weekend and is a doubt while striker Johnny Russell missed the 3-2 win at Vicarage Road with what turned out to be a fractured fibula and he will remain on the sidelines.Head coach Steve McClaren will continue to be without midfielders Paul Coutts (dislocated kneecap), Jeff Hendrick (ankle) and James Bailey (knee) and goalkeeper Adam Legzdins (ankle).Jesse Lingard has been ruled out for Birmingham, meanwhile, while Tom Adeyemi will be assessed.On-loan Manchester United striker Lingard sustained a knee injury during last weekend's hugely disappointing 4-0 defeat at Leeds and will now sit out as Blues aim to restore some pride.Influential midfielder Adeyemi missed the heavy loss at Elland Road due to illness and faces a race against time to line up against the Rams.Midfielder Jonathan Spector (thigh) and full-back Neal Eardley (knee) are both long-term absentees.
