Simon Grayson insists promotion was always Preston's priority this season after their 2-0 Johnstone's Paint Trophy defeat to Oldham.The Lilywhites were two goals down inside 10 minutes at home to Latics after James Wesolowski and Danny Philliskirk punished slack defending from the hosts.Preston's immediate focus now turns back to League One, where they currently sit in the play-off places ahead of the visit of lowly Crewe on Saturday.And boss Grayson admits his side cannot afford to give other teams a helping hand if they are to succeed this season."I want to win every game and I told that to the players before the match and I've told them afterwards as well," he said."But if somebody said to me would you rather have won the game a month ago against Oldham here in the league or this one then it's a no brainer, the league's more important to us."This football club is all geared up to play Championship football. It' a nice day out at Wembley but that's a long way off and our focus is on the league."In the first half we made a lot of wrong decisions all over the pitch and at times we were trying to play one or two-touch football in our own 18-yard box and that's suicide football."To go two down after 10 minutes was a real kick where it hurts but we got to grips with it a little bit after half-time and we could have quite easily got back into it."
