Brian Laws praised his Scunthorpe side's ability to bounce back after they claimed a narrow 1-0 win at Fleetwood on Tuesday.Sam Winnall's second half strike, which took a huge deflection on its way into the back of the net, secured a smash-and-grab victory over Graham Alexander's men, who suffered a second consecutive defeat.Iron boss Laws was delighted to see a return to winning ways after their 4-0 weekend capitulation at the hands of Exeter."We could have felt sorry for ourselves after Saturday's performance but we didn't," said Laws."It's all about bouncing back and playing with honesty."It was a tough game but I think tactically we got it right."After the break we controlled the game for larger periods. We started to pass it nicely and that brought us a chance for us to get a shot on goal."It took a big deflection on the way but it gave us something to hold on to."
