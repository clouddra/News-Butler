Neal Ardley hopes AFC Wimbledon's 2-1 win at Rochdale will provide the springboard to propel them back up the League Two table.The Dons ended a run of six games without a win thanks to goals from Sammy Moore and Andy Frampton at Spotland."I think we are going to be stronger for the past month we have had," said Ardley."During the past week in training I have seen a group of players that are trying to put actions into place, rather than words. They do care and they do not like losing."There were so many good performances. In the second half we started believing that we were a good team and showing some of the stuff that we do in training, but we have to use it as a catalyst to be more consistent."
