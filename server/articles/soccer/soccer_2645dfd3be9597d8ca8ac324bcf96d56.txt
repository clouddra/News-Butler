Middlesbrough defender Justin Hoyte is training with Millwall in the hope of landing a loan deal at The Den.The 28-year-old full-back has been restricted to just three Championship appearances this term, with only one of them seeing him fill a starting berth.Boro revealed over the summer that they would be willing to listen for offers for Hoyte, with the acquisition of Frazer Richardson leaving them well-stocked at the back.No agreement has been reached as yet, but Millwall are prepared to take a look at a man who graduated out of the famed academy system at Arsenal.He moved to Middlesbrough in 2008 and has made over 150 appearances for the Teesside club.It appeared as though he would be heading to pastures new in 2012, as he was released at the end of his contract, but Tony Mowbray brought him back into the Boro set-up on a two-year deal.That agreement will expire at the end of the season, so Hoyte is eager to get regular football and put himself in the shop window.He may get the chance with Millwall, with Lions boss Steve Lomas looking to reinforce a squad which is perched just three points above the second tier drop zone.
