    MOTD3 pundits John Hartson and Kevin Kilbane and Stoke City goalkeeper Asmir Begovic discuss whether Arsenal can win the Premier League this season having moved five points clear at the top of the table after 
    
Saturday's victory against Liverpool.
    Kilbane says Gunners will not win the title as they have a weaker defence than their rivals, while Hartson believes the January transfer window will prove crucial to many team's bid for the Premier League crown.
    The trio also talk about the "unpredictability" of the league this season after some recent shock results, including 
    
Chelsea's 2-0 loss at Newcastle.
