    Hull City manager Steve Bruce says that referee Andre Marriner was correct to send off two Sunderland players in the 
    
first-half of their 1-0 victory at the KC Stadium.
    Lee Cattermole was dismissed for a foul on Ahmed Elmohamady while Bruce described Andrea Dossena's tackle on David Meyler as a "horror challenge".
    An own goal by Carlos Cuellar was enough to give Bruce a win over his former side.
