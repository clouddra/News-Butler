    Bury have confirmed Ronnie Jepson will remain caretaker manager until January.
    The 50-year-old former Gillingham boss took temporary charge after 
    
Kevin Blackwell was sacked in mid-October.
    The Shakers have since picked up one point from Jepson's two games as boss and sit 20th in League Two.
    As a player, former striker Jepson scored 12 goals in 59 games during an 18-month spell at Gigg Lane.

A club statement read:Â  

     "The priority at this time is stability. With this in mind, Ronnie will stay as the caretaker manager until January and the current backroom team will also remain."
    It continued: "The past two games have demonstrated to us that the players have the desire to play for Ronnie.
    "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with him to make sure that we deliver on the pitch."
    Last weekend 
    
Jepson refused to be drawn on whether or not he wanted the permanent job at Gigg Lane.
    He was only appointed assistant manager in June after two months without a club following 
    
his and Neil Warnock's departure from Leeds United.
