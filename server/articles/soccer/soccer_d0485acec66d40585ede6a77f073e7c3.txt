RKC Waalwijk manager Erwin Koeman will watch Saturday's Eredivisie match against Roda JC from the stands after he was given a one-match touchline ban for criticising a referee.The KNVB disciplinary committee handed down the ban, which will mean Koeman's assistants Roy Henriksen and Rob Maas will take charge of the game at Mandemakers Stadion.Koeman had made comments about referee Ed Jansen following the 2-1 defeat at PSV Eindhoven on October 6.
