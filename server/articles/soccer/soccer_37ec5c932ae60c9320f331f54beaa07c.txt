We've got work to do - we have had a fairly tough programme, but one point on average per match is worse than we had planned."Regarding the win over Stoke, he added: "I hope it was a turning point."It was a truly important win. Without it, it would have looked really bad."It is still early in the season. We should not get stressed, but we are hoping to get more in the future and advance in the standings."I would like us to collect some points in the two upcoming matches, before the two difficult matches."It is possible to take points against United and Liverpool. We've got a tradition of taking points against the top clubs at times."
