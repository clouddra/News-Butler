• Fitch: Birthday boy Villas-Boas deserves fans' patience

Townsend, 22, has been in the headlines this week after two impressive displays for England were followed by an incident involving manager Roy Hodgson.

During half-time of England's 2-0 win over Poland that booked their place at the 2014 World Cup, Hodgson made a joke that involved the phrase "feed the monkey".

Townsend insisted he had taken no offence by the remark, while Tottenham boss Andre Villas-Boas said "we should all move on."

Villas-Boas was speaking on Friday ahead of Sunday's meeting with Aston Villa, and his comments were followed by an announcement that evening that Townsend has extended his stay at the club.

The winger has agreed a new four-year contract, having made a breakthrough in the first team this season, making six Premier League appearances so far.

The England international was sent out on loan to Queens Park Rangers last season where he impressed, scoring twice in 12 appearances.
