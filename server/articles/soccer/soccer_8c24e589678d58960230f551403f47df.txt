                        Birmingham manager Lee Clark was furious after losing 4-0 to Leeds and labelled his side's performance as atrocious.                    "It's nothing to do with systems. Why are we obsessed with systems? We didn't defend or close down properly. We didn't do our jobs."We got what we deserved today. The general performance in the first half was not acceptable. Leeds won every first and second ball and passed it better than us."We defended like young players but we don't come out here and criticise. We win and lose together."We didn't give ourselves a chance today, we gave ourselves a mountain to climb."
