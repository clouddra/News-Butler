Manchester United defender Patrice Evra has denied rumours that he wants to quit the club in the summer.Reports suggested that Evra would not sign an extension to his Old Trafford contract, which is due to expire in the summer, and he has been linked with Paris St Germain and Monaco.The France defender hinted that personal reasons, which are believed to be a desire to return home, might force him to leave Old Trafford.David Moyes' much-publicised interest in Leighton Baines and Fabio Coentrao during the summer transfer window are said to have unsettled the Frenchman, but the 32-year-old insists that is not the case."I did an interview in France and I said it was personal," said Evra, when asked on MUTV about his contract situation.




"I haven't seen what people are saying but the thing is if someone wants to talk about my contract, which is ending after this year, they have to talk to Manchester United and with my agent. Me? I love this club so much."

I love this club so much."Speaking earlier this week, United manager David Moyes offered his support to Evra and praised the player's influence at the club.The 32-year-old has been at the centre of a public feud with former France international Bixente Lizarazu, who Evra has accused of deliberately trying to tarnish his reputation while talking about him on French television.Moyes was quizzed about his French full-back at Tuesday's press conference ahead of United's UEFA Champions League game against Real Sociedad and he had nothing but praise for him."I don't know how you see Patrice in France but in Manchester we have a very high opinion of him," he was quoted by L'Equipe."He has been a great figure in the dressing room since I have been at the club."
