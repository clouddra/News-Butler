Defender Peter Murphy has hailed the never-say-die spirit which has lifted Accrington off the foot of the League Two table.Stanley occupied the basement of the Football League pyramid for most of the early part of the season with boss James Beattie, in his first ever managerial post, having to wait until the 13th attempt to claim all three points.However, Beattie has now presided over a five-game unbeaten run which has seen Accrington leapfrog Northampton in the table and Murphy, who has struck late goals in successive weeks, insists confidence never wavered even during that 12-match winless streak."Since the start, even when we weren't getting the points, no-one's ever been down," he told the club's official website."The gaffer just keeps saying the same thing and he must have known it would work and he made us believe it and now it is working."Murphy knows his team's next task is to move out of the bottom two altogether, and he added: "When you're on the bottom the only way you can go is up so let's just go a bit further."
