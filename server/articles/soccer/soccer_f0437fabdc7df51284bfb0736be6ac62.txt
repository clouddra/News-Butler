Coventry hot shot Leon Clarke has highlighted City's creativity as one of the biggest reasons behind their success this term.Clarke is one of the main beneficiaries having bagged 11 goals to date, topping League One's scoring charts alongside strike partner Callum Wilson and Leyton Orient's David Mooney.Clarke's latest goals came in Saturday's 3-0 victory over Notts County, with the well-travelled 28-year-old opening the scoring two minutes after half-time with the Magpies having been reduced to 10 men just before the interval.The Sky Blues went on to dominate proceedings following the break, Clarke grabbing another before Wilson also got in on the act, to ensure Coventry have now registered a more than impressive 34 goals from 15 games this term."It was a great win for us as they made it really difficult in the opening stages," the striker told City's official website. "They came to shut down the way we play and that worked in the first half."Of course the sending-off helped us but it can often be difficult playing against 10 men. It was important to get the goal early in the second half as I knew we would win the game from there."We created so many chances in the second half and we probably could have scored more. We have done that all season and it is probably the reason we are doing so well."Credit has to go to the young players really as they have stepped up this year. It is hard to believe that some of them are in their first full year of first-team football."Coventry are now just three points outside the League One play-off places despite starting the season with a 10-point deduction.
