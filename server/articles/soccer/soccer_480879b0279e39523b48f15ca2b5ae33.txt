Del Grosso challenges Mbaye.Livorno provided some relief to coach Davide Nicola with a 1-0 win over 10-man Atalanta on Sunday.Paulinho's goal in the 11th minute was enough to earn the Amaranto all three points and ease some of the pressure on Nicola following the team's poor recent run.Atalanta shot themselves on the foot after midfielder Carlos Carmona was handed his marching orders for a second bookable offence with just 34 minutes played.Livorno held on without a major scare to record their first win since September 15.The hosts went into the game on a seven-match winless run, but enjoyed a great start.Leandro Greco fed Paulinho in the area and his right-footed shot towards the far post beat Atalanta goalkeeper Andrea Consigli.Andrea Luci's powerful volley from just outside the area was then kept out by Consigli.Atalanta had their first opening in the 27th minute when Carmona got behind Luca Cigarini's cross and his header was saved by Livorno keeper Francesco Bardi.But Carmona's match was soon over as he was shown his second yellow card after a late challenge on Ibrahima Mbaye.Despite the setback, Atalanta reacted and could have equalised before half-time had German Denis' header from Cigarini's free-kick not gone wide.The hosts almost doubled their lead shortly after the re-start when Paulinho surged into the area and dribbled round the keeper only to see his goal-bound shot cleared off the line by Lionel Scaloni.Livorno substitute Alfred Duncan came agonisingly close to doubling his team's advantage in the 88th minute as his left-footed strike from 15 yards hit a post with Consigli beaten.And with one minute remaining Atalanta substitute Giuseppe De Luca missed a good chance to equalise when his header from Cristian Raimondi's cross was saved by Bardi.
