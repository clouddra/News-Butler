AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli risks missing next week's Champions League meeting with Barcelona after sustaining a thigh injury.The 23-year-old Italy international has missed three consecutive league games through suspension and will now sit out a fourth - against Udinese on Saturday - due to an "astus intermedius muscle injury to the right thigh".A statement published on Milan's official website confirmed Balotelli would be "monitored over the coming days" before a prognosis is determined.Should further tests rule the striker out for longer than a week, he will not feature against Spanish champions Barcelona in Tuesday's Champions League group game at San Siro.Balotelli sat out Italy's World Cup qualifying draw in Denmark during the international break but scored an equaliser from the bench in Tuesday night's 2-2 draw with Armenia.
