Catania have sacked coach Rolando Maran and replaced him with former Genoa boss Luigi De Canio.Maran has paid the price for the club's woeful start to the new Serie A season, which has seen them win just one of their opening eight matches.A 2-1 defeat to Cagliari on Saturday proved the final straw, with Maran now making way for De Canio.A statement on Catania's official website read: "Calcio Catania announces that it has dismissed the coach of the first team Mr Rolando Maran, who we offer our most heartfelt thanks to for the work he has done and best wishes for his future career."De Canio has been without a club since being sacked by Genoa in October 2012 after a six-month spell at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris.
