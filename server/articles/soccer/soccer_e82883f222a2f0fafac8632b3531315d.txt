Italy coach Cesare Prandelli has brushed aside concerns about Gianluigi Buffon's form after the Juventus goalkeeper's struggles at Fiorentina on Sunday.The 35-year-old came under fire after conceding four goals in 16 minutes against the Viola as Juve's unbeaten run was halted with a 4-2 defeat in Florence."For me Gigi is the best goalkeeper in Italy," Prandelli said to www.figc.it. "He is the number one and he will be a starter in the World Cup in Brazil."There is no Buffon situation. Gigi has my maximum trust."Juve have conceded 10 goals in eight Serie A games, nine more than league leaders Roma."I think defences are being penalised much more than in the past," Prandelli said."You have to adapt to certain situations by which, in order to avoid conceding a penalty, you are forced to give more space in the area to rival strikers."Italy captain Buffon is in his 13th season at Juve and has won the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award nine times.
