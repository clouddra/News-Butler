Portsmouth winger Ricky Holmes admits his goal against Exeter on Saturday had more than a touch of fortune about it.Holmes' cross got carried by the wind straight into the Grecians' net to put Pompey on their way to a 3-2 win."It was a worldy wasn't it?" he smiled."No, it was a cross and thankfully the wind picked up right at that point."I didn't hit it very hard - I was just looking to get the ball towards the back stick and it caught everyone by surprise."It was a good time to score, just before half-time. We'd been on top at that point and thankfully we went on to get all three points."
