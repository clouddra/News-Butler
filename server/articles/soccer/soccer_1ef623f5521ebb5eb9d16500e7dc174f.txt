Inverness Caledonian Thistle's Terry Butcher 

     has agreed personal terms to become Hibernian's new manager, BBC Scotland has learned.
    Hibs are yet to comment but it is believed they hope to agree a compensation deal with their rivals.
    Caley Thistle stress that they have had no request for permission to approach the 54-year-old.
    And chairman Kenny Cameron says he has received assurances from Butcher that he has not spoken to Hibs.
    "Wherever this has come from, it is completely untrue," said Cameron in a statement.
Cameron says he talked with Terry Butcher after training on Monday
