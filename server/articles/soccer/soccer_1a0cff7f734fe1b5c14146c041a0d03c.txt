Peterborough United chairman Darragh MacAnthony has revealed that the club will be exploring the loan market.The Posh have wobbled slightly of late - taking one point from their last three fixtures - but remain third in the League One standings.A run of three goals in their last five games has raised concerns regarding the firepower in a previously free-scoring side.It is felt that fresh faces could help to reignite a season which is focused around pushing for an immediate return to the Championship.MacAnthony will do all he can to help Darren Ferguson deliver results on the field, with market moves set to be sanctioned if required.In the wake of a 3-1 reversal against table-topping Leyton Orient on Saturday, the Posh supremo posted on Twitter: "Great chat with the gaffer. We both know what needs addressing to bring pace, aggressiveness and goals back into our games - and how to get back to winning matches."Pressed by one supporter on whether that means another look at the loan market, MacAnthony added: "It would be rude not to."
