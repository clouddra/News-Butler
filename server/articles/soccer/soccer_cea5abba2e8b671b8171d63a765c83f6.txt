Marc-Andre ter Stegen's agent has denied speculation his client has an agreement with Barcelona and claimed he is in talks about renewing his current deal with Borussia Monchengladbach.The Germany goalkeeper was linked with the Spanish champions over the weekend but his representative Gerd vom Bruch insists such talk is wide of the mark."It is pure speculation," Vom Bruch told the Rheinische Post newspaper, although he did confirm the 21-year-old was a man in demand."There are two or three really good teams that are interested in Marc."And there is also Borussia. We are going to talk about a contract extension with Gladbach."
