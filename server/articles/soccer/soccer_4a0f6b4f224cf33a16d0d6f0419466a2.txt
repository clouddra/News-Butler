Mali international midfielder Kalifa Cisse's hopes of earning a contract with Derby look likely to be ending in disappointment.Free agent Cisse, formerly of Reading and Bristol City, has been on trial with the Rams for three weeks and has played in two development squad matches against Hull and Middlesbrough.Derby are short of bodies in midfield with Jeff Hendrick, James Bailey and Ben Davies out injured, and John Eustace will be suspended for the home game against Sheffield Wednesday at the weekend after collecting his fifth yellow card of the campaign in the defeat at QPR on Saturday.However, head coach Steve McClaren says Cisse, 29, is unlikely to be offered a deal."He is going to play in the under-21 game at Huddersfield (on Monday) but I don't think we are going to do anything with Kalifa," said McClaren after Derby's 2-1 loss at Loftus Road.
