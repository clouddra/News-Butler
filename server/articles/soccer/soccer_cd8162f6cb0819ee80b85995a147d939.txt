New AZ Alkmaar coach Dick Advocaat believes his side have great potential ahead of his first Eredivisie game in charge against Cambuur on Sunday.Advocaat returns to AZ, the club he managed between 2009 and 2010, after spending time in charge of Russia's national side and last year's Dutch runners-up PSV Eindhoven, and he revealed he turned down several offers to do so."I recently rejected four clubs, including a very, very large club," Advocaat told az.nl."Normally I'm not always easy to convince, but I was by AZ. I would have done this for no other club."I know the team that I'm going to work with as I have seen almost every game on television, so I have a good picture of this team."It is a very fresh and talented team with great potential. Moreover, the margins in the Eredivisie are getting smaller and I'm curious where we can reach."I want AZ to play attacking football."AZ are currently ninth in the overall standings with four wins and a draw from their first nine games but will fancy their chances against Cambuur, who are only two points above the bottom three.Ajax boss Frank De Boer, meanwhile, expects a tough test when his side travel to De Grolsch Veste to take on leaders FC Twente on Saturday.Following their strong start to the campaign, which saw them head into the international break top of the pile, De Boer believes Twente could be in the running to win their first Eredivisie title since 2010."They are definitely a title contender," De Boer told Ajax TV."They have a good and wide selection so when emergencies arise that they can cope fine. They have a lot of talent in the team."Of course (midfielder Dusan) Tadic is their best player, he would not look out of place at Ajax. Furthermore, they play good football and try to be dominant."In the other games, Saturday sees Go Ahead Eagles take on Feyenoord at De Adelaarshorst while RKC Waalwijk are at home to Roda JC, FC Utrecht play NAC Breda and Vitesse Arnhem travel to Heerenveen.On Sunday, Heracles Almelo host NEC Nijmegen while PSV make the trip to FC Groningen as PEC Zwolle take on ADO Den Haag.
