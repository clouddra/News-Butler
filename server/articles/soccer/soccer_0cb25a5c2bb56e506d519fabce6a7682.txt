Chris Wilder was happy to see Oxford maintain their League Two promotion push after a goalless draw at Accrington.Fourth-placed Oxford travel to third-placed Exeter on Tuesday and Wilder is delighted to see his side up among the top guns in the table, where just three points separate the leading nine teams."Realistically we are in the pack and it's a tight league," Wilder said. "We are still unbeaten away from home and we are there in the race, which is where we want to be."Wilder was disappointed with his side's first-half showing at rock bottom Accrington but was pleased his side impressed after the break - despite not getting the vital goal they craved."In the first half we were off the pace," he said. "We did not get going and there were harsh words said at half-time."But we dominated possession after the break and created chances but we just weren't able to stick one away. Their 'keeper pulled off some unbelievable saves and, on another day, we could have got three points."But it's another point towards our total and we were up against a side who are fighting for their lives and gave their all."We will take a point and now move on to Tuesday."
