Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp has rejected suggestions that he received offers from Manchester City and Chelsea in the summer.Reports emerged over the weekend claiming Klopp turned down overtures from both English clubs in the summer as they searched for new managers before the appointments of Manuel Pellegrini and Jose Mourinho respectively.Klopp, who leads his Dortmund side into Champions League battle against Arsenal on Tuesday night, insists he never had any offers from City or Chelsea, but hinted he could be interested in a move to the Premier League in the future when he "improves his English"."I think it was a summary of everything I said, because I never said I had offers from these two clubs," Klopp is quoted as saying in the Guardian."I am 46 and in some cases of life it's not so young and in some cases it's young enough."I have to work and I want to work for a few more years and maybe in the future when my English is better, maybe then I will come to England."The grass isn't always greener and my biggest skill is to see luck when I have it. So I don't think about different clubs and I never said the name of one or the other."
