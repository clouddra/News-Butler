Floyd Ayite and Serge Aurier tangle.Toulouse moved up to seventh in Ligue 1 after a winning penalty by Martin Braithwaite two minutes from full-time guided them to their fourth win in five games with a 2-1 success at Reims.Oscar Trejo had put the visitors ahead three minutes before half-time with Prince Oniangue equalising after 58 minutes.The game appeared to be heading for a draw only for Antoine Devaux to foul Clement Chantome in the box which saw the Reims player sent off and Braithwaite firing down the middle to claim a second successive win for Toulouse.It was tough on Reims but takes Toulouse to within six points of Monaco at the top of the table.The visitors had the first chance when Trejo's close-range volley forced Kossi Agassa down for a good save.It was then Reims' turn to attack, Nicolas de Preville firing in a fierce shot which Ali Ahamada blocked with difficulty.The goalkeeper was again called upon when Floyd Ayite found Gaetan Charbonnier and his header was thwarted by Ahamada.With half-time approaching, Toulouse took the lead. Braithwaite crossed towards Wissam Ben Yedder who laid the ball to Trejo in front of goal and he slotted the ball past the onrushing Agassa.Chantome's curling free-kick was seized by Agassa and then moments later his team were level.Aissa Mandi combined with Courtet on the left and he in turn freed Oniangue at the edge of the area who then curled a shot home.Ayite then unleashed a curling free-kick with Ahamada pulling off a world-class save to prevent the hosts from going ahead.The clock was ticking down and a draw appeared likely until Devaux's intervention which saw him leaving the field and Braithwaite firing Toulouse to victory.
