"I really enjoy it when other players today follow my idea, that it lives on and has not died, it gives me a lot of satisfaction. For me it would be very exciting, a real honour that one of the best players in history tries it. Although his own style is doing pretty well for him so far."Other / ESPN statsLionel Messi played the familiar role of Barcelona hero against Valencia.Messi, who suffered a thigh injury when scoring in Barca’s 2-0 win at Almeria in late September, has missed the 1-0 Champions League win at Celtic and 4-1 La Liga win at home to Real Valladolid.But having spent the recent international break working on his fitness with his club, he now looks set to be back in action ahead of next Tuesday’s Champions League group game in Milan and -- most importantly – Oct. 26’s Primera Division clasico against Real Madrid at the Camp Nou.The Argentine, who Mundo Deportivo say last summer rejected a move to an 'Adidas club' who were ready to pay his €250 million buy-out clause, posted a photo of himself at training on Thursday evening to his personal Instagram account.The image was accompanied by the phrase -- 'Ready to come back' -- suggesting he is looking forward to starting on Saturday evening in Pamplona.
