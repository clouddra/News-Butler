Southend manager Phil Brown was thrilled to see Barry Corr get back among the goals in his side's 2-0 win against Fleetwood.The striker had gone 12 games without hitting the back of the net but he bagged a brace against the Cod Army and got the better of his former flat-mate Ryan Cresswell to fire the Shrimpers to a third successive league win."I'm pleased for big Barry and it's great for him to get back among the goals again," said Brown."He hasn't got a goal in 12 games but he kept on going and he got his rewards."There was a bit of spice on the game for him because he was up against his mate but as far as I'm concerned I hope he can play against an ex-Southend centre-back he's mates with every week now."His goals got the win but it was a hard-working display and I thought we deserved all three points."The 4-3-3 formation worked well again and that's three league wins in a row for us now so I'm obviously very pleased, especially as we've kept clean sheets in all of those matches as well."
