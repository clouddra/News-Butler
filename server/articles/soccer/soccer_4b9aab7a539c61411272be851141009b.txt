Former Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn says there is a "high probability" the national team will win next year's World Cup.Kahn was part of the side which were beaten in the final of the 2002 World Cup, since when they have reached the semi-finals twice, and the 44-year-old believes they are now ripe for the title."Successes like in the Champions League give the players the decisive kick," he said. "That gives them the conviction that, by getting the better of the best in Europe, then they can also become World Champions."Last season's Champions League final between Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich included many members of Joachim Low's current Germany squad, including one of Kahn's successors in the Germany goal, Manuel Neuer.Speaking about a topic he knows a great deal about, he also said that Neuer's opposite number on that day in Wembley, Roman Weidenfeller, would also be worthy of a call, ahead of Hamburg's Rene Adler."Adler is a good goalkeeper, but he's not playing in [European competition] for Hamburg," Kahn added in the Bild newspaper."Weidenfeller, on the other hand, is playing every Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday and he'd more than deserve a call."He also has a great character. He's a total professional and would be anything but a spoilsport."
