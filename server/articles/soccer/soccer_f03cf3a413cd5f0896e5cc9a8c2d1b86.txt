Peter Taylor believes Danny Kedwell could be his lucky charm as he scored to help Gillingham to a 1-0 win over Carlisle.Kedwell netted the only goal of the game, and his sixth in as many matches, from the spot just past the hour-mark after Danny Livesey had clumsily fouled on-loan Gills midfielder Danny Hollands.Carlisle's day got worse as Lee Miller was sent off for an off-the-ball incident with Adam Barrett, but Gills defender Leon Legge was to receive a second yellow soon after for a foul on David Amoo.Taylor, who admitted before the visit of Carlisle that he has two more matches until the Gills decide on a permanent boss, is backing Kedwell to carry on scoring for him."Danny has scored in every game for me so far," Taylor said."I'm pleased for him, he really does work hard. I still think he is going to get better, but he is certainly getting enough goals."The performance wasn't a massive step, the three points were. It was a massive game for us. Our first-half performance wasn't good enough."I didn't think we had enough options going forward, which is why I played two strikers in the second half."There were a lot of players out there who had a bad day."That happens, but as long as it wasn't through a lack of effort it is ok and in the second half we gave ourselves more of a chance."I was surprised with the first yellow for Leon, the second one was spot on, but I thought we should have had a second penalty late on."Cody McDonald may have been too honest for not going down, but for me it is a definite penalty. The player pulled him back."
