Accrington boss James Beattie has his sights set on mid-table after his side climbed off the bottom with a 1-1 draw against Wycombe.It had looked like Anthony Stewart had secured the points for the visitors. Defender Stewart got on the end of Josh Scowen's corner in the 72nd minute and his close-range shot went in off the inside of the post.But Peter Murphy scored his second last-gasp goal in a week to secure a point for the Reds and extend their unbeaten run to five games.Now Beattie wants to see Stanley stretch their streak and move out of the relegation spots."We would have liked it to have been a last-minute winner but the late goals show the spirit we are building within the team," said Beattie."We never give up and never know when we are beaten and you can see the confidence in the team which we have got after a few wins."Confidence is the most important thing for a footballer and you can't give them confidence in a drink, it is something which has got to come from the players and they are playing with more confidence now thanks to our recent run."It's pleasing to be off the bottom but we are a work in progress and we don't want to be anywhere near that area and we have got to keep producing the results."
