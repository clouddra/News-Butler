Real Betis defender Damien Perquis broke his jaw in two places in a clash of heads that left the Poland international unconscious in Malaga on Sunday night.An aerial challenge for the ball between Perquis and Malaga striker Fabrice Olinga in the 51st minute of an eventual 3-2 win for the home side left the centre-back prone on the Rosaleda pitch.He was taken to a local hospital by ambulance after regaining consciousness and medical tests subsequently confirmed a "double fracture of the jaw".On Monday, Perquis will be transferred to his club's home city of Seville to consult with a maxillofacial surgeon - a specialist in head, face, jaw and neck injuries.A statement published on Betis' official website read: "Damien Perquis has suffered a head injury that caused him concussion with a loss of consciousness, and that is why he was urgently moved to the Carlos Haya hospital in Malaga."Once stabilised, a double fracture of the jaw was found. Perquis is currently conscious and will be transferred to the Fremap Hospital in Seville, where he will be evaluated by a maxillofacial surgeon."Perquis, 29, was accompanied to hospital by Olinga, who was visibly upset, Malaga's Polish striker Bartlomiej Pawlowski and Rosaleda club directors Martin Aguilar and Vicente Casado.Betis have not yet offered a prognosis for Perquis' recovery but he is expected to miss at least a month of action.
