In-demand Atletico Mineiro forward Bernard is to visit Shakhtar Donetsk but claims no deal has been struck as yet.The Ukrainian outfit have leapt to the front of the transfer queue after putting a tempting bid on the table.Bernard, who is expected to head for Europe this summer, is prepared to see what they have to offer.With his valuation having been met, the 20-year-old is intrigued to see what Donetsk would hold for him before he commits to anything.He told TV Alterosa: "It's just a visit, there won't be any medical. Nothing is certain and I won't sign any documents."I made it clear to them that I would only visit so that I could see their facilities."Bernard has previously been linked with a move to England, with Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal said to be keen, but Shakhtar are the only side to have met his asking price.Speaking to Radio Itatiaia, Atletico president Alexandre Kalil said: "Tottenham made an offer of €18million (£15.7m) for Bernard, but they withdrew."Arsenal told us that they would bid, but never did. So what we have now is a €25m (£21.8m) bid from Shakhtar."
