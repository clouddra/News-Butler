Jamie Mackie says he hasn't given up on international football and wants to play for Scotland at Euro 2016.The Nottingham Forest striker has scored twice in nine appearances for his country, netting against both Cyprus and the Faroe Islands, but has fallen out of favour and was not called up by Gordon Strachan for the midweek victory over Croatia.But 28-year-old Mackie, who was playing non-league football five years ago, says Scotland are improving under their new boss and he wants to be involved in their bid to reach the next European Championship in France.He told FL72: "I'm not sure I had too many expectations about being in the latest squad because I didn't really feature the last time I travelled."I want to play. I've got nine caps now and from where I've taken myself in football to play for Scotland and score a couple of goals at international level is amazing. I'd love to carry on doing that."However, I've got to make sure my club form is as top as I can make it and hopefully I can force my way back into that squad. That's my aim and hopefully I will do that."We didn't win a game at home in the qualifiers until the other night, which was a great win, and we also won away so it's obviously going in the right direction."There's some really good players up there and whether I'm involved or not involved, I hope the boys can qualify for the European competition next time around."Mackie left QPR for Nottingham Forest over the summer, but has only scored one goal in his 12 appearances for the club so far.But after missing much of pre-season he insists his scoring record will improve when he is fully fit and integrated at Forest, who are currently fourth in the Championship.He added: "I scored fairly early in my Forest career and I wanted to go on a run, but that hasn't really happened."I have played in a few different positions, but I have settled in now and I missed games in pre-season and although I am a fit lad it does take time to get into your full stride."I feel I've got that now and I'm sure the goals will come. I just need a couple of goals and I'm very confident in my ability to get on a run and do well."But it has been fairly frustrating. I've missed good chances, but I'll keep putting myself there and luckily we are in touching distance and doing well."
