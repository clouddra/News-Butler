    Crystal Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen says the players are hurting after a 
    
2-0 defeat at West Brom 

     but have not given up hope of staying in the division. 
    Goals in each half from Saido Berahino and Gareth McAuley condemned Palace to a seventh successive league defeat.
    They have lost all but one of their 10 Premier League games this season and are six points away from safety.
