Internacional have told potential suitors of Leandro Damiao that they will only part with him for the right price.Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton have previously been linked with the Brazil international striker, but their interest appears to have cooled as Internacional aim to keep hold of one of their star men.They are prepared to let him leave if an acceptable offer is submitted, but have previously told Napoli that a bid of €18million (£15m) would not be considered and stressed that his valuation is only likely to increase after next summer's World Cup.Zenit St Petersburg are reported to have joined Napoli in the chase for the 24-year-old's signature, but it will be difficult for anyone to prise him away.Internacional's director of football Marcelo Medeiros told Zero Hora: "He is focusing on Internacional."If anyone wants to sign him, it would be a great deal, but they will have to pay a lot."He is still an Internacional player."
