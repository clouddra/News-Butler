CSKA Moscow have decided to move their Russian Premier League game against Krasnodar on Sunday due to the "dire state of the pitch" on which they played Manchester City on Wednesday.City manager Manuel Pellegrini and several of his players were strongly critical of the Khimki Arena surface both before and after their 2-1 UEFA Champions League victory.The ground had passed a UEFA inspection, but Sunday's fixture will now be played across Moscow at the Eduard Streltsov Stadium."Due to the dire state of the pitch at the Khimki Arena and based on the recommendations of the league, the match of the 14th round of the SOGAZ Russian Premier League will now take place at the Eduard Streltsov Stadium," said a statement on the club's website.Prior to facing City, CSKA had played their previous Champions League 'home' game against Viktoria Plzen more than 400 miles away in St Petersburg.Several domestic fixtures have also been moved while groundstaff try to fix a surface which suffered extensive damage during a period of heavy rain earlier in the year.Both Pellegrini and midfielder Yaya Toure referred to the state of the pitch when assessing the importance of City's win on Wednesday."It was very important," Toure said. "This was a very difficult place to practice good football but full credit to the team. We worked hard and it was not too easy."
