Swansea City boss Michael Laudrup has confirmed that Roland Lamah could be among those allowed to move on this summer.The 25-year-old midfielder only moved to the Liberty Stadium in January, agreeing an 18-month loan switch from Osasuna.He has, however, been restricted to just one start during his time at the Liberty Stadium and remains on the fringes of Laudrup's plans.The Swans boss claims to know nothing of reports suggesting Lamah could be a target for FC Copenhagen, but admits he will not stand in the Belgium international's way if a suitable offer is put to him.Laudrup said in the South Wales Evening Post: "I don't know anything about Copenhagen wanting Roland and he is in our squad right now."But let's see what happens in what's left of the transfer window."He has not been playing until now this season and he played less than he expected last season."You always want a player to be a big success when you bring him in, to score lots of goals and play every game, but you can only use a certain number of players."
