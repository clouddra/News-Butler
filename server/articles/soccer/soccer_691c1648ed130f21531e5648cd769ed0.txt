Zlatan Ibrahimovic: Celebrates one of his two goalsTwo goals apiece from Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic against Bastia maintained Paris St Germain's momentum in Ligue 1.Ibrahimovic netted twice in three minutes in the first half before his replacement matched the feat after the interval as Laurent Blanc's men won for the fourth successive match.The thumping 4-0 success improves their goal difference and gives them a three-point advantage over Monaco at the head of the table ahead of their fellow unbeaten rivals' match with Sochaux on Sunday.Bastia have not won at the Parc des Princes in 25 top-flight encounters, while the capital side are having their best start of the season since 1996/97.It was little surprise therefore when Hervin Ongenda freed Ibrahimovic inside the area and the Swedish striker beat Bastia goalkeeper Mickael Landreau with a flamboyant finish in the 10th minute.It was 2-0 just three minutes later. A free-kick from Brazilian winger Lucas found an unmarked Ibrahimovic, who made the visitors pay with a powerful header.The lively Ongenda set up Adrien Rabiot for a shot which Landreau did well to keep out, before the Corsican side managed their first effort just before the half-hour mark, although home stopper Salvatore Sirigu was equal to Wahbi Khazri's curling free-kick.Landreau denied Lucas before the interval before Cavani, who replaced Ibrahimovic at half-time, went close soon after his introduction.However, the Uruguayan was not to be denied and in the 62nd minute he showed neat footwork to outwit Gilles Cioni and Landreau before finishing into an empty net to the delight of the home support.With 13 minutes remaining Cavani's effort hit a post and he found the side-netting with the rebound.But a minute from time, he had his second from the penalty spot, wrong footing Landreau after the goalkeeper had brought down Lucas Digne inside the area.
