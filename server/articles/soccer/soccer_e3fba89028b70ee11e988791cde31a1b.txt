PSV Eindhoven stunned Ajax with a second-half goal blitz as they routed the defending champions 4-0 to climb to the top of the Eredivisie standings.After a goalless opening period, PSV ran riot during a 15-minute spell after the break when they scored four times without reply to end a run of six competitive matches without a win in emphatic fashion.Tim Matavz opened the floodgates in the 53rd minute following a mistake by Ajax keeper Kenneth Vermeer and then Jetro Willems (61), Oscar Hiljemark (64) and Park Ji-sung (68) struck in rapid succession to finish off the visitors, who also lost by four goals to nil to Barcelona in the Champions League on Wednesday.The result sees PSV, who suffered a shock 2-0 home loss to Ludogorets in the Europa League on Thursday, move two points clear of the top of the standings after previous pacesetters PEC Zwolle slumped to a second successive defeat, going down 3-0 at Vitesse Arnhem.On-loan Chelsea forward Lucas Piazon scored twice for Vitesse, with his goals in the 35th and 88th minutes sandwiching a strike from Kelvin Leerdam (68).Feyenoord continued their improved form with a 1-0 home win over FC Utrecht, Tonny Vilhena netting the only goal 10 minutes before half-time, while in Sunday's other Eredivisie match NAC Breda beat AZ Alkmaar 3-0.Danny Verbeek, Rydell Poepon and Elson Hooi all struck second-half goals for NAC who have now won back-to-back matches and scored eight times in the process having started the season with three defeats and two draws.
