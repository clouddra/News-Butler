    A superb goal-line clearance by Linfield's Billy Joe Burns denied 10-man Crusaders victory at Windsor Park.
    Defender Burns somehow flung himself to block a Jordan Owens header under the crossbar after Chris Morrow had sent in a good cross from deep on the left.
    Crusaders midfielder Declan Caddell had been sent-off in the 72nd minute for a tackle from behind on Jamie Mulgrew which earned him a second yellow card.
    The result ended Linfield's seven-match winning run in the league.
    David Jeffrey's men have, however, extended their lead at the top of the table to four points as third-placed Portadown lost away to Ards and Glenavon had been beaten 3-2 at home by Ballinamallard on Friday night.
    In the first half Mulgrew had cleared off the line at the far post to keep out a Colin Coates header from a Morrow corner.
    After the break, Crusaders keeper Stephen O'Neill made a fine diving save to turn Matthew Tipton's shot over the bar.
    Crusaders are now second ini the table, ahead of Glenavon of goal difference.
