Justin Edinburgh says his Newport side proved their critics wrong with their 3-0 win over York.County had gone two games without a win in League Two but bounced back with a comfortable victory at Rodney Parade.First half goals from striker Chris Zebroski and midfielder Lee Minshull plus a late strike from Danny Crow moved County to within four points of league leaders Chesterfield as they bounced back from their thumping at Rochdale last week.Edinburgh said: "I am absolutely delighted, we were short last week but I felt there was quite a lot of negativity in the whole city and people were apprehensive coming here even though we've only had one bad performance in 2013 since New Year's Day."People need to be a bit more realistic, but I felt they didn't make us feel nervous, they backed us and I was delighted for my players, they were worthy for a win."My line-up was particularly difficult, any of the ones who dropped out couldn't complain and the ones who stayed in were lucky."I told the players who I kept in that they owed the ones who dropped out a good performance, because anyone could have bitten the bullet after last weekend."It's one bad performance and we have to keep that in perspective and we controlled the game well. There was a turning point when Yakubu made a great interception and we went up the other end and scored."After that we played on the front foot and could've won by more."The players did exactly what I asked, we wanted a reaction and it came and everything we said we'd do we did."I was especially thrilled for Tom Naylor. He hasn't played since the Morecombe game where he had his mishaps (two own goals and a conceded penalty) and he really stepped up and marshalled our midfield well."We know it's about the squad, we have a lot of depth and each and every week we've got players who are missing out who will legitimately feel like they should be playing."
