    Sam Allardyce says West Ham side "can't find the back of the net" following 
    
a 0-0 draw at home to Aston Villa.
    The Hammers boss believes it was "very important" for his side not to lose after three consecutive home defeats, but is disappointed by their lack of success in front of goal.
    With 
    
Andy Carroll still two weeks away from a return to training 

     and Carlton Cole lacking match practice after he 
    
re-signed for the club, 

     West Ham started without a recognised centre-forward for the fourth successive Premier League game.
