Toni Kroos has revealed that he is in discussions with Bayern Munich regarding an extension to his current contract.The Germany international is already tied to the Bundesliga giants until 2015, but both parties have expressed a willingness to put fresh terms in place.Kroos is happy with the role he has played under Pep Guardiola this season and believes he is in the right place for his ongoing development.The 23-year-old admits he cannot say what will happen further down the line, but for now he is happy to discuss a prolonged stay at the Allianz Arena.Kroos told Kicker-Sportmagazin: "I am in touch with Bayern Munich regarding a new deal."This will get more important as the expiry date in 2015 approaches more and more. There is no infinite amount of time. Everyone knows that."I have a basic interest in signing a new contract. If I keep on going like I am, everything will be fine."I am not a fan of telling people I will be a player of Bayern Munich in 10 years' time. So much can happen. Five-year deals can be cancelled after just one season."
