Gareth Ainsworth has expressed his delight following his Wycombe side's 1-0 win away to 10-man Bristol Rovers.Experienced Scottish striker David Clarkson was sent off for catching Wanderers midfielder Josh Scowen with a flailing arm as they battled for possession in midfieldIt left Rovers facing an uphill battle and although they fought hard Wycombe substitute Max Kretzschmar netted the only goal eight minutes from time, shooting into an empty net after fellow substitute Jon-Paul Pittman's low drive had been parried by Rovers goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall.Rovers boss Ward said: "I'm not going to make any fuss about the sending-off, even though I felt it was harsh at the time. These decisions go against you sometimes and I thought the way the team and the supporters responded was excellent."There isn't a violent bone in David's body. If anything I wish he was more aggressive at times. But I'll watch it again on film before making up my mind."Wycombe's Ainsworth added: "There was contact with our player, but I was too far away to see if there was any intent."The referee and his assistant have decided that there was and it was obviously a key moment of the game. Having said that, Rovers made it really difficult and were really well organised, as I would expect of a John Ward team."I told the lads at half-time that we would need to be patient and that it might take 80 or even 90 minutes to make our pressure tell. In the end we wore Rovers down and I couldn't be more pleased with my team."All three substitutes made a big impact. We threw on some fresh legs up front and in the end got the result our football deserved."It is a very tight league and we are taking nothing for granted at this stage."
