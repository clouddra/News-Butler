Ajax were given a lucky escape when their inflatable training dome collapsed moments after Frank de Boer had cancelled a practice session.Heavy winds in Amsterdam caused the damage and pictures on Ajax's website show the damage done to their facility, with the dome shredded to pieces.Minutes earlier, De Boer had called off the training session as they prepare for their KNVB-Beker Cup tie with amateur side ASWH because he "found the risk too great"."This was a good choice," said the former Holland international defender.
