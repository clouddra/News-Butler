James Beattie was happy with Accrington's display in their goalless draw against Oxford and feels three points will come soon.Hosts Stanley enjoyed the better of the first half against high-flying Oxford, who hit back after the break and were only denied by a super show from on-loan goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli as he kept out Dave Kitson, Sean Rigg and Michael Rayne.Beattie's bottom of the table side are still hunting their first league win of the season but he was upbeat after taking a point from the U's."We would have taken a point before the game as Oxford are a good side who will cause problems for a lot of teams in this league," Beattie said."But I was pleased with individual performances and collectively. The lads are disappointed they have drawn with a side who are doing well in the league which is a good sign."We have drawn three out of the last four and, if we keep turning in performances like that, we will get our first win and more will follow."
