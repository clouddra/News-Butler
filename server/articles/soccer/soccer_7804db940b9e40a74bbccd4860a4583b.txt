In this [Riether’s] instance, the panel were of the unanimous decision that it was an act of violent conduct.”Riether now has until 1800 BST on Tuesday to respond to the charge.United manager David Moyes earlier on Monday called for more protection for Januzaj, saying: "Adnan is going to need a little bit of protection or we are going to find that he is getting kicked up and down. I do think he deserves a little bit more than he is getting at this present time.""We have spoken to him about it. He gets kicked up and down in training every day. But he gets up. Adnan has learned from the good professionals that he has got to get on with it and accept it."He only needs to look at Lionel Messi, who is probably the best in the world at getting kicked, getting up and getting on with it and continually producing magic all the time."I am not in any way comparing him to Lionel Messi but I am saying we hope the way he gets up after he has been kicked is the way Adnan continues to behave."
