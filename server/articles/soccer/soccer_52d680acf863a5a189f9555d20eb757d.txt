    Manager Brendan Rodgers praises Liverpool's "character" in coming from behind twice to earn a 
    
2-2 Premier League draw 

     away at 10-man Newcastle.
    Yohan Cabaye's long-range effort was cancelled out when Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard converted a penalty - his 100th Premier League goal - awarded after Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa was sent off for a foul on Luis Suarez. 
    Substitute Paul Dummett shot the Magpies back in front before Daniel Sturridge headed the Reds level following great "combination play" with Suarez.
