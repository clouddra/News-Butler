The Football Association is celebrating its 150th anniversary this weekend in central London.A gala dinner will take place on Saturday night at the Grand Connaught Rooms, the site of the Freemasons' Tavern where, 150 years ago, the FA was founded.The original FA Minute Book from 1863 which laid down the first laws of the game drafted by Ebenezer Morley and his contemporaries will take pride of place.Leading FA figures, along with famous England players from past and present, will attend while the event will highlight the FA's not-for-profit commitment which sees £100m re-invested into the game.Guest of honour, FA President HRH the Duke of Cambridge said: "I am a football fan. I have loved the game from a very young age - as a player with my friends, and as a supporter of club and country."I consider it a huge honour to lead The FA - it is an organisation which reaches every community, bringing the simplest enjoyment to people of all ages and all abilities."Over 150 years, football has become part of the very fabric of our society and I hope the year ahead will allow us to celebrate every aspect of this great game.
