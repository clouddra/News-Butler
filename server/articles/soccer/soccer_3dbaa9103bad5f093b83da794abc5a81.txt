And, in our case, the Capital One Cup probably represents our best chance of success," he told the Daily Star."Obviously, recent seasons have suggested it is not as important to the bigger clubs, which means it's a competition that is up for grabs."Swansea showed what can be done by winning it last year. Hopefully, we can follow in their footsteps this season."We have got a fantastic opportunity and it is one we are determined to take."With a place in the Europa League on offer to the winners, it is a competition we are taking very seriously."This club has never competed in European competition and it would be great to be part of a Hull team which made that happen."
