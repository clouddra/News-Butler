Plymouth Argyle boss John Sheridan has revealed that he has been snubbed in loan approaches for three strikers.The Pilgrims have found the target just 10 times in 15 outings this term - the worst record in League Two.Sheridan is looking to address the issue, but has been left frustrated in his efforts to bring in added firepower.Paul Hayes has been allowed to return to Brentford at the end of his loan spell in an effort to free up space in the squad, but moves to bring in further reinforcements have drawn a blank.Sheridan is hoping for good news as he continues to scour the market, but concedes that geographical obstacles are standing in his way.He told The Herald: "I keep getting the same answers, and it's not the agent or the club, it's just the distance the player has to come."That has happened with three strikers over the last two weeks."The clubs have agreed the deals. It's just the travelling, and I do understand that, so we have got to keep going."There are plenty of young strikers out there, so do I take a chance with one of them? That might be - might be - the way I have to go."We have got one or two strikers we are looking at. We have got scouts looking at a couple."
