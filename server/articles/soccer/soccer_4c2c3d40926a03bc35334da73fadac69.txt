PSV Eindhoven head coach Phillip Cocu was left to rue his side's lack of ruthlessness in the final third after Sunday's 1-0 loss at FC Groningen cost them the chance to topple FC Twente at the Eredivisie summit.Filip Kostic's 50th-minute goal settled the match at the Euroborg and condemned the visitors to their second league defeat of the season, leaving them a point behind Twente.Cocu was happy with his team's overall display and acknowledged home goalkeeper Marco Bizot had had a fine game, but felt the result should have been different."I'm obviously not satisfied with the 1-0 defeat, but happy with our style of play," he said on www.psv.nl."I think it was probably one of our best performances of the season so far. We did all we could and put in a decent team display."Bizot was outstanding, but I think we didn't really reward ourselves enough and should have converted our chances into goals. FC Groningen scored one goal from a counter-attack, while we are left empty-handed."Groningen coach Erwin van de Looi admitted his team had been fortunate to collect the win, which lifted them to seventh place in the standings and within a point of PSV."Luck was on our side, but we've worked our socks off and threatened on the counter-attack," he said."With the support of our fans, we sustained constant pressure and finally managed to beat one of the top teams. So we're very happy with the 1-0 win."
