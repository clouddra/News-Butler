Gary Rowett believes the convincing 2-0 victory at leaders Chesterfield provided the perfect answer to anyone who doubts Burton.Rowett's side controlled the game from start to finish and a first-half brace from Adam McGurk sealed a fourth away win of the campaign.Lee Bell sent McGurk clear of a static defence in the 10th minute to place a low shot past Tommy Lee from 12 yards and McGurk struck again in the 14th minute when another quick Burton counter ended with Chris Hussey crossing from the right for the striker to steer a header inside Lee's right-hand post.Robbie Weir should have made it three but missed an open goal from close range in the 24th minute and Lee had to save from McGurk six minutes into the second half.Jordan Pickford made late saves from Jay O'Shea and Armand Gnanduillet but Burton were comfortable winners.Rowett said: " We were fantastic, in truth we could have won it by three or four."We created some terrific chances and the game plan worked really well. I am pleased as punch for the players because one or two people have questioned if we can be up there again."But I don't think there are many teams that are much better than us in this division. That's why we have been really frustrated with our points tally over the last six games so to come here and do that here was absolutely magnificent."Adam has been threatening to do that for probably the last two or three months. We know what an absolutely quality player he is, he's a real class act."
