Sao Paulo president Juvenal Juvencio has suggested he will try to bring Paris St Germain attacker Lucas Moura back to the club.Moura left Sao Paulo to join PSG in January, but the Brazil international has struggled to make a sustained impact with the French champions.The 21-year-old recently insisted that he is happy with PSG after he was linked with a return to his former club when the transfer window reopens.Juvencio would welcome the prospect of signing Moura on loan, but conceded that it will not be easy to conclude a deal."Of course I am interested," Juvencio is quoted by UOL. "Lucas Moura is my total priority. I talked with him recently, he visited the training ground, went to the dressing room."Let's see if it's possible. I'll do what I can. I'll try to bring him back on a year-long loan, then he can extend his contract with PSG for a year, or I'll give them another youth player."I know it won't be easy, but I want him here. I am waiting until we are in a safer situation in the league before dealing with this."However, Moura's agent Wagner Ribeiro has dismissed the likelihood of the player leaving PSG to return to Sao Paulo.Ribeiro said: "There is no chance. Lucas Moura has been playing, he likes the environment, his team-mates, Paris."He is doing very well there and Paris St Germain invested â‚¬43million to sign him. He has just bought a house there, left the hotel and his mother is going to live with him."
