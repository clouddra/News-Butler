    Manager Arsene Wenger says the arrival of Mesut Ozil has given a "big lift to everyone who loves this club," after the German international scores twice in a 
    
4-1 win 

     over Norwich.
    Jack Wilshere and Ozil gave the Gunners a two-goal lead before Jonny Howson pulled one back for the visitors. But goals from Aaron Ramsey and Ozil secured a comfortable win for the home team.
    The victory was Arsenal's seventh in their last eight Premier League games.
