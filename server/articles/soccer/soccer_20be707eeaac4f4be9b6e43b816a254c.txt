Crawley manager Richie Barker questioned his players' desire to score following their 1-0 home defeat to Brentford.An early penalty by Adam Forshaw settled the contest after a foul by Kyle McFadzean on Kadeem Harris.Barker said that it was time for one or two of his players to "stand up and be counted" after seeing his team slip to a third straight defeat.He said: "Brentford won the game through a rubbish penalty. There was not a lot in the game and Brentford got the three points because of a greater desire."A lazy, sloppy tackle has cost us. We were lazy after four minutes and some of the players need to change their mindset a little bit."You need to be switched on from the start, that's why some of my players aren't playing at the next level. One poor piece of defending has separated the teams."No one works harder than me, I can't do anymore. It's my job to prepare them, then it's up to them."It's hard for me to criticise a group of players who have worked so hard. If they haven't got that drive, then there's not a lot I can do."Sometimes you have to question the mentality of the players. Did they really want to score? I'm not so sure that they did."
