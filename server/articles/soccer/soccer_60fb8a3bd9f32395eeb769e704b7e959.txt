Evian's top-scorer Kevin Berigaud has been ruled out for six weeks after sustaining a thigh injury against Guingamp.The 25-year-old striker has scored six goals in 10 Ligue 1 matches this season but, after leaving the Parc des Sports pitch after 73 minutes of Saturday's 2-1 home defeat, he could miss eight games.A statement published on Evian's official website read: "Kevin Berigaud was hit in the right thigh during our match against Guingamp on Saturday night and further medical tests have revealed he will be unavailable for an estimated period of six weeks."The former Servette forward is the only Evian player to have notched more than a single goal in the new campaign, which sees the Annecy outfit struggling at the wrong end of the table.Pascal Dupraz's men are currently 16th and this weekend travel to face bottom side Valenciennes.
