St Johnstone have been boosted by the news that Steven MacLean has not suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury.MacLean was stretchered off during his side's 4-3 win over St Mirren last Saturday and it was feared he may have suffered a serious knee injury.Saints boss Tommy Wright is confident the injury will not rule out the striker for several months, but admits it is a big blow to lose the 31-year-old."The good news this morning is that the consultant has reported no damage to his cruciate and at this stage we just have to let the knee settle and then give him rehab," Wright told the club's official website."Steven's absence will be weeks in length rather than what we first feared - a season-ending injury - but it is still clearly a big blow for the player and the club."
