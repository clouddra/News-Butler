Gareth Ainsworth praised Matt Bloomfield after making his long-awaited injury return as Wycombe knocked Bristol City out of the JPT.Billy Knott and Bloomfield - making his first start in over a year - netted in the first half at Adams Park to put City on the back foot.Brendan Moloney hit a thunderbolt after the break to reduce the deficit but the visitors rarely looked likely to grab an equaliser - leaving Ainsworth to reflect on a welcome return for Bloomfield."He is in his testimonial year, he has been out for a year and he has come back and he is a real warrior for Wycombe Wanderers," said Ainsworth."This is his club, he loves playing for this club and it's great to have him out there. He is not just a great player, he is a great organiser."I'm teaching Stuart Lewis to be the captain but Matt Bloomfield has it as well."When we are so young it's good to have these people out there, getting them in shape and encouraging. It all worked for Matt so I'm pleased for him."It was like Jo Kuffour took his kids out. It was unbelievable the way we played because we were so young."I thought we made Bristol City look very ordinary in the first half. I'm really pleased but really want to get back to winning ways in the league."
