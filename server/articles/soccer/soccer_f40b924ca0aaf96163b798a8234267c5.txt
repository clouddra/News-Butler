Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen has labelled teammate Aaron Ramsey as the “best player in the Premier League at the moment”.

• Cross: Sublime strikes fire Gunners to victory• Mangan: Gunners team no longer easy to pick

The 22-year-old Ramsey continued his flying start to the season with a goal in the Gunners’ 4-1 rout of Norwich, taking his tally to nine goals in all competitions.

Ramsey’s fine form is not only confined to his club, with the Wales international scoring three goals in his homeland’s failed quest to reach next year’s World Cup.

And Vermaelen said there was no better player in England’s top league and, in a dire warning to rivals, predicted there was more to come from the youngster.

"Aaron is doing incredibly well," Vermaelen told The Sunday Mirror. "He showed it again against us (Belgium) in midweek with his goal. He is the best player in the Premier League at the moment.

"He is scoring goals and looking really sharp with his passing. He's doing extremely well. He's been unbelievable for us.

"He got the Player of the Month award, scoring goals, playing well and showing he is important for us.

"There is more to come from him because he is young."
