Highly-rated striker David Accam is ready to shun interest from England in favour of furthering his development at Helsingborg.The 22-year-old has been watched on several occasions by scouts representing some of Europe's top clubs.Arsenal are among those to have cast an eye over the Ghanaian forward, who spent time in the English non-league ranks earlier in his career.Accam is flattered to learn of the reported interest in his services, but feels it would be advisable to remain in Sweden for the foreseeable future and continue working on his game.He told Fotbolltransfers.com: "There is no risk that I will leave Helsingborg this summer."I prefer to stay here and continue my progress. I am satisfied with the season but believe I can do better and I still have much to learn."It's encouraging to hear about the interest, but we play nice football and that is the reason many clubs come to watch our matches."Accam's agent has confirmed that interest in his client has been mounting steadily, but insists no official approaches have been made.Phil Radley said: "Some big clubs have seen David this season, among them are clubs like Arsenal and (Borussia) Dortmund."There are also other clubs from England, Germany, Holland and Russia, but there has not been any contact with these clubs."
