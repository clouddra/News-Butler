Millwall boss Steve Lomas believes the Lions have stopped the rot after Jermaine Easter's last-gasp leveller earned them a 2-2 draw against QPR.The Lions welcomed Rangers to The Den on the back of two heavy defeats to Birmingham and Bournemouth but twice fought back against Harry Redknapp's side.The impressive Niko Kranjcar put the visitors ahead in controversial fashion as QPR broke up field and opened their account on 26 minutes after referee Mike Dean had waved away a strong Millwall penalty appeal when Charlie Austin appeared to trip Liam Trotter.Scott McDonald equalised after the break - the first league goal Rangers had conceded in nine matches - before Austin put QPR back ahead, only for Easter to have the final say."I thought it was no more than the lads deserved, considering the quality that QPR have," said Lomas."We then went for it, we had four forward on at the end."I'm delighted that the lads have responded after two very hard to take results.This should be the bare minimum and now we have got to re-group and go again for a very tough game at Reading."We hung in there and got a fine result and to come from behind twice is credit to the lads."Us conceding the goal off of the penalty incident was our fault, we should have dealt with it better. But for me it was a blatant penalty, Mike Dean is a very good referee and he only gives what he sees but for me it was a blatant body check."

                        Redknapp hit in face by ball                    QPR remain unbeaten in the Championship but lost ground on leaders Burnley and are now two points behind in second, albeit with a game in hand.Assistant manager Kevin Bond preferred to focus on the positives however, most notably the form of former Tottenham midfielder Kranjcar."Niko Kranjcar is a magnificent footballer," he said."He has got that top class quality, he can see things and he can execute things as you saw today, he was excellent."I don't know whether I was surprised. He has obviously worked with the manager before and was comfortable to come back and but we are delighted that he has come back. We are very pleased and lucky to have him."I thought we should have won the game we pretty much from a possession point of view controlled the game. We were in charge. We didn't create as many chances for a side that had as much of the ball."They always carried a threat, they looked like they might get on the end of something but I thought we did well and went in front and we went in front again. We were still the better side but that is football."
