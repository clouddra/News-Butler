    Manager Steve Bruce says it is a "disgrace" that Gareth Barry was not sent off for his tackle on Sone Aluko in 
    
Hull City's 2-1 loss at Everton.
    Bruce also believes Everton's first goal should have been disallowed for Barry getting a touch on Kevin Mirallas's effort when he was in an offside position.
    However, the Tigers boss says he will take "a lot of heart" from the match as Hull fought back with Yannick Sagbo's equaliser before Steven Pienaar scored the winner 10 seconds after coming off the bench.
