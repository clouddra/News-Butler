Kilmarnock boss Allan Johnston has insisted that the club will be taking every precaution over the future of Rabiu Ibrahim.The midfielder spent two nights in hospital this week after collapsing during the 2-0 win over Ross County at the weekend.The 22-year-old has since been released and the club are awaiting further specialist advice on his condition.Johnston said: "His results have been sent to a specialist and we are just waiting for some feedback to give us a bit of guidance and see what we've to do."He went down, he was feeling dizzy and he can't really remember what happened."At the time I thought it was a knock because he got a knock about 30 seconds beforehand."It wasn't until later on at half-time that the physio told us what happened."You can't take any chances with that so we will speak to the medical people and get advice from them."
