Mario Balotelli has been assigned a former police officer to act as personal assistant by AC Milan in a bid to keep him out of trouble off the field.

The Italy international continues to attract unsavoury headlines, most recently for breaking a reporter’s microphone in Naples and, on Tuesday, for leaving the San Siro without wearing official club uniform or colours.

Such incidents should be limited in future after the Rossoneri assigned Filippo Ferri to keep a close eye on the player, according to the Gazzetta dello Sport.

Ferri, who was prohibited from official police activity for his part in heavy-handed treatment of protesters at the G8 summit in Genoa in 2001, already works as a security advisor for the Rossoneri and is therefore well-known within the club.

His brief will be to ensure Balotelli’s off-field behaviour no longer eclipses the talent he shows on the field, although the president of the Italian Football Association (FIGC), Giancarlo Abete, says Ferri will not be needed when the forward is on international duty.
“Balotelli is one of us and, within the national team, everybody assists each other,” he said. “In any case, it’s up to his club to evaluate this.”
