El Salvador have banned 14 national team players for life for their role in alleged match-fixing in games against the United States and Mexico.One other player was given an 18-month ban, two were suspended for six months, one was acquitted while four more face further investigation, the country's football federation president Carlos Mendez said."The work of the disciplinary commission has been exhaustive. We have used valuable information which has come from interviews, video accounts from people who have had the strength to declare and help us find those  responsible," said Mendez.The 14 given life bans were goalkeepers Dagoberto Portillo and Miguel Montes, defenders Ramon Flores, Miguel Granadino, Luis Anaya, Mardoqueo Henriquez, Alfredo Pacheco, Marvin Gonzalez and Reynaldo Hernandez and midfielders Osael Romero, Darwin Bonilla, Dennis Alas, Ramon Sanchez and Christian Castillo.The bans are connected with suspected match-fixing in four games involving the national team, including a 2-1 defeat in an exhibition against the USA in 2010 and a 5-0 loss to Mexico in the 2011 Gold Cup.Last month, 22 players received one-month suspensions while the games were investigated.
