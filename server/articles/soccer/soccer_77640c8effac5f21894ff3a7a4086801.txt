Russell Slade wants his players to stay positive as Leyton Orient bid to bounce back from their first defeat of the season.Orient's stunning run of 12 matches unbeaten came to an and against Coventry on Tuesday night, but they remain top of the table and Slade expects them to bounce back quickly when they face Rotherham on Saturday."It would have been very difficult to go through the season without losing a game, so it had to happen eventually," he said."It is important to remain positive. The players have got character, they galvanise each other and Saturday is a great opportunity, at home, to get a good result against another decent side."We are still top and there is nearly a third of the season gone. It would be fantastic to get a result on our own ground in front of our fans."
