Brian Laws thought his Scunthorpe side were unfortunate to be on the wrong end of a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Exeter.Midfield man Liam Sercombe set the ball rolling when he fired the Grecians in front against the run of play in the 34th minuteThen two quickfire second-half goals from the visitors really floored Scunthorpe.Midfield man Arron Davies scored with a tremendous dipping 35-yard effort before setting up Sercombe to net his second of the afternoon two minutes later.Substitute Sam Parkin then completed the scoring in the 90th minute after fierce second-half pressure from the home side had gone unrewarded."People will look at the scoreline, but this was never a 4-0 result," he insisted."In the second half we had 12 corners and 20 efforts at goal but for some reason could not get the ball in the net."What was most disappointing for me was the lethargic way we started."But the turning point of the game was Exeter's second goal at the beginning of the second half, just at a time when we were looking to try and get back into the game."I am sure he did not intend it. It was a fluke from that distance into the top corner."Then the third goal came so quickly and that was a poor one for us to give away."But I was pleased with the response I got from my players in the second half."Obviously the result is a big disappointment for us and we have got to bounce back now at Fleetwood on Tuesday night - just as Exeter have done after losing at home to Hartlepool last week."
