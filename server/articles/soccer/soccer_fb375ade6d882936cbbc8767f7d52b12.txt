    New Sunderland manager Gus Poyet describes his side's 
    
4-0 loss at Swansea 

     as "not a nice welcome to the Premier League" for him.
    Phil Bardsley's own goal gave Swansea the lead before Jonathan De Guzman and Wilfried Bony made it 3-0 in seven second-half minutes. Chico Flores added a fourth late on to give the hosts their first home win in the league this season.
    Sunderland remain bottom of the table with just one point from eight Premier League games.
