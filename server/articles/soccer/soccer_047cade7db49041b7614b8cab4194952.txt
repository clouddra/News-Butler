Aston Villa are likely to be without striker Andreas Weimann when Cardiff visit Villa Park on Saturday.The Austria international limped out of the goalless draw against West Ham just before the hour mark after pulling up with a hamstring problem.Villa manager Paul Lambert will take no risks over Weimann's fitness ahead of the international break which follows Saturday's visit of Cardiff."It looks like a hamstring at the minute. I don't know how severe it is," Lambert said."The thing is we've one more game then we get a break, so hopefully the break helps him."But Lambert expects to have midfielder Fabian Delph available to face Cardiff after he was forced to miss Saturday's stalemate at Upton Park due to illness."Fabian pulled out of training on Thursday. He came in on Friday, but he still didn't look the greatest so we sent him home," added Lambert."There's been a bug going around. Ciaran (Clark) had it the other week, so hopefully Fabian will be all right for the next game."
