Cheltenham boss Mark Yates was left to rue what he viewed as two soft goals that gifted Rochdale a 2-1 away win.Ian Henderson struck in the 81st minute to make it 1-1 after Troy Brown had opened the scoring for the home side and Henderson won it in the second minute of time added on."How we've conceded two goals I don't know," he said. "The timing of them were cruel."We knew Rochdale were a decent side, but we nullified them and kept them quiet, but then switched off twice and lost the game."It's tough for the boys, but it shouldn't have happened. Players got in each other's way for the second, going for the wrong ball and poor decisions cost us, otherwise we could have been talking about a great 1-0 win."At 1-1 we had a good chance with Russ Penn blazing over the bar and it's fine margins. We are lucky we have a game at home to Morecambe on Tuesday to try and put it right."We played some decent stuff at times and we were 1-0 up so it's a tough one to take for everybody. The only way to sort this out is to better and stronger and put a big performance in on Tuesday."
