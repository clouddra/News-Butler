    Swansea City boss Michael Laudrup says his side's 
    
1-0 defeat to Welsh rivals Cardiff 

     is "disappointing for everybody" at the club.
    Steven Caulker's towering header gave Cardiff victory over 10-man Swansea, who had goalkeeper Michel Vorm sent off for a challenge on Fraizer Campbell. 
    The fixture was the first top-flight meeting in the two side's 101-year-old rivalry with Cardiff leading the head-to-head with 44 wins to Swansea's 35.
