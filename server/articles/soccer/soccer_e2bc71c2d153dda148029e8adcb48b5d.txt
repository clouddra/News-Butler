3-1 win at Craven Cottage 

     but trained before the team flew to Spain on Monday.
    "We haven't had a lot of injuries," said Manchester United manager David Moyes.
    "I think it's the best Manchester United have been in that respect for a while. But we did pick up three on Saturday, which is very rare - especially by half-time. 
    "Two of them haven't travelled - Jonny Evans and Rafael - so they're not with us."
    United top Group A with seven points from three games, while Sociedad are bottom and without a point.
    "I won't take anything for granted," added Moyes.
    "I have a lot of respect for Sociedad. We have to play well if we're going to get those 10 points, which will get us over the line. We've got ourselves into a good position in the group and we have to try to maintain that.
    "I think our experienced players have shown they're used to the Champions League."
