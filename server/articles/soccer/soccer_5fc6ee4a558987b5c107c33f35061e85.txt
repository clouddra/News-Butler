New Nurnberg boss Gertjan Verbeek has set his sights on helping the team avoid the drop after agreeing a deal with the Bundesliga strugglers until June 2015.The former AZ Alkmaar coach has replaced Michael Wiesinger, who was sacked earlier this month, and is joined by assistant Raymond Libregts.The club confirmed the appointments on their official website and the pair were presented to the media on Tuesday ahead of their first training session with the players.Dutchman Verbeek told a press conference: "I am happy that I can work here. There are great traditions here in Nuremberg at a historic club."I had my first talk with the coaching team today. We will quickly put the focus on Stuttgart (whom Nurnberg face away on Friday)."I of course have some ideas. But it is always about the qualities of the players."The goal this season is to stay away from the lower reaches of the table."To do that Verbeek needs to start picking up wins. The club have not won in their opening nine Bundesliga games and lie third bottom of the table.The 51-year-old has only coached in Holland and most recently enjoyed a three-year spell at AZ.He said: "I will take German lessons to improve my German. I hope that it will happen quickly."Nurnberg sporting director Martin Bader insisted Verbeek's lack of Bundesliga experience would not be a problem.Speaking to Bayerischer Rundfunk, Bader said: "He knows the Bundesliga very well. In the discussions that was absolutely not an issue."For the most part he knew our players very well not only in terms of their names, but also their strengths and weaknesses."I believe it does not have to be a negative not to have worked in the Bundesliga when you have the fundamental abilities."
