Aaron Ramsey says he fully accepted being put on the bench by Arsene Wenger for Arsenal's 4-1 win over Norwich.The Wales midfielder came on as a 37th-minute substitute for Mathieu Flamini at the Emirates on Saturday and turned in another superb display.He netted his 11th goal of the campaign for club and country and also set up Mesut Ozil for the fourth Gunners goal.Ramsey said: "The boss said before the game that he was going to rest me today. I've played a lot of games recently, including two lots of 90 minutes for Wales."But Mathieu got injured in the first half and I had to come on. I thoroughly enjoyed being out there, in front of our home fans, getting a win like that and going back to the top of the league."

                        Ramsey's reaction                    When asked why he continues to be prolific, Ramsey responded: "I've said this many times now to the media. I've always got into those positions in my career and not been so composed, but now I'm feeling really confident in front of goal, and comfortable putting the ball in the back of the net."Arsenal now hold a two-point lead at the top of the table after eight games, the first of which they lost at home to Aston Villa."That's what we've suffered with in the last few seasons - being quite slow to start," he added."But we've come out of the blocks after the first game, which was a big upset for us. We've started off really well and bounced back since then."The confidence is high. Everyone's playing with a smile on their face and enjoying themselves. We're happy to be back at the top of the league and hopefully we can stay there for a long time now."Ozil, who turned 25 on Tuesday, was equally delighted with his afternoon's contribution, which included a rare headed goal. The Germany midfielder tweeted to his 3.8million Twitter followers: "4:1 against Norwich with a header from me - a late birthday present. Thanks all."4:1 against Norwich with a header from me - a late birthday present. Thanks all.
