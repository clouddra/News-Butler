Matt Jarvis hopes his domestic form at West Ham United will put him in contention for a place in England's World Cup squad.The tricky winger has been capped on one previous occasion by his country, during his time at Wolves.He has seen others edge ahead of him in the creative pecking order since then, with Tottenham Hotspur's Andros Townsend the latest to shine on the international stage.Jarvis is refusing to throw in the towel, though, and believes eye-catching outings for the Hammers will help to put him in Roy Hodgson's plans for Brazil 2014.The 27-year-old told The Sun: "I want to play as well if not better than last season - score more goals and add assists."And if I can do that, I'll try to get in the England squad. Of course Andros has given me hope. You can always use that belief that he's done it, so why can't I?"Jarvis also believes that Upton Park team-mate Ravel Morrison will come under consideration next summer following a hugely impressive start to the season for the Hammers and the England U21s.He added: "I don't see any reason why Ravel can't make that England squad. He is a fantastic talent."He's had a fantastic start to the season and if he can keep playing well week in, week out he can go very far."I joined last season and he was out on loan so I've only really seen him this season. But from what I have seen, he's been as good as gold."
