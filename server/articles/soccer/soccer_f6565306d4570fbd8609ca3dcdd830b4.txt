Martin Jol feels Darren Bent could still force his way into England's World Cup squad if he can find the net on a regular basis for Fulham.Bent has scored three goals since arriving at Craven Cottage but his lack of playing time for Sunderland and Aston Villa means it is two years since his last international appearance.But Jol feels Roy Hodgson's recent selections of Jermain Defoe and Rickie Lambert mean Bent should not feel like his England hopes are over."You never know," the Fulham boss said when asked about Bent's chances of making the plane for Brazil."(Selection) can be a spur of the moment thing because if Bent scores five goals in the final month of league then he could be in contention again to be selected."Bent is one of best finishers in England, he is like Defoe. And Defoe has a big chance to go to Brazil I think and Danny Welbeck is probably similar. They are all good players."Fulham's form has improved in the last month or so but three points at Southampton on Saturday would mean a third straight Premier League win under Jol for only the second time."People don't realise that in the last four games (in all competitions), we only lost once," Jol said. "That was against Cardiff, which was disappointing, but we turned a corner four or five weeks ago."I think there is only one team in Europe who did better or equalled Southampton defensively and that is Roma."They are the only team to concede three in the Barclays Premier League. They have strong athletes, they have stamina and strength at the back and they are organised."It is a good team, they are solid in defence, but they go forward. If you have (Rickie) Lambert, Osvaldo and (Adam) Lallana up front you have quality."Fulham's trip to Southampton on Saturday is live on Sky Sports 1 with the programme starting at 5pm
