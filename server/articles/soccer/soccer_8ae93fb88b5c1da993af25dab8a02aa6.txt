Brazilian outfit Palmeiras admit to being admirers of Zenit St Petersburg striker Hulk, but have no plans to bring him home.Palmeiras will be toasting their centenary in 2014, and a marquee signing has been mooted to tie in with the celebrations.Plenty of speculation has suggested that Hulk is the man in their sights, with the burly frontman known to be a supporter of the club.Any deal would, however, come at a price, with Zenit having spent big to secure Hulk's services in September 2012.The Russian outfit have not entirely ruled out the prospect of a loan switch being sanctioned, but interested parties have been quoted eye-watering fees.With that situation unlikely to change any time soon, Palmeiras accept that a deal for the 27-year-old is out of their reach.Executive director Jose Carlos Brunoro told Globo Esporte on the Hulk rumours: "We are always interested, but that is a lie."There is no chance that happens. We haven't even thought about it."
