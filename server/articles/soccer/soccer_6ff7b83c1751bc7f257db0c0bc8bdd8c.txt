New Catania coach Luigi De Canio is convinced the Sicilian club have the potential to do well this season.De Canio, 56, has taken charge of the side in place of Rolando Maran, who was sacked on Sunday after a string of poor results.The former Genoa coach, who has signed a contract until the end of the season, said to CalcioCatania.it: "I am convinced that Catania is a club where a coach can work well."I know that there is a possibility here to get important professional gratification."Catania have won just one of their opening eight matches and last weekend's 2-1 defeat at Cagliari left them in 17th place, level on five points with Sassuolo, who are in the relegation zone.De Canio, who has also coached at QPR and Lecce, added: "I will try to give the team a spark. We have quality players and everyone has to be ambitious."Any result can be reached provided we make the most of our potential."I believe I have the experience to bring out the best from my players."De Canio has been without a club since being sacked by Genoa in October 2012 after a six-month spell at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris.His first game in charge will be against promoted side Sassuolo on Sunday.
