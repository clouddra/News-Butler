Colchester have completed the signing of teenage striker Dominic Vose on a rolling contract.The former West Ham trainee had been on trial with the U's following his departure from Barnet in the summer.Manager Joe Dunne told the club's official website: "We are pleased to have him on board."He's had a successful trial and fits the bill of someone who has lost his way in the game a bit, but has the drive and hunger to get back into it again."That desire and hunger is really important to me. He will go straight into Saturday's squad for the trip to Rotherham."
