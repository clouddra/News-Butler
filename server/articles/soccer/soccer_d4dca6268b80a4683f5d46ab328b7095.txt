    Manager David Moyes says Manchester United must be more "ruthless" despite their 
    
1-0 Champions League win over Real Sociedad.
    An Inigo Martinez own goal ensured United remain on course for the knock-out stages, but Moyes pointed out that it was the 
    
second game in a row 

     where his side created plenty of chances but scored only once.
    United's next Champions League match is a visit to Sociedad on 5 November, while they face Stoke in the Premier League at home on Saturday.
