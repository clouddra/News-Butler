Aberdeen striker Scott Vernon admits he feels like a different player after rediscovering his goalscoring touch.Vernon came off the bench to fire an impressive winner against Inverness last month and followed that up with a hat-trick against Falkirk in the League Cup.The 29-year-old Englishman scored 28 times in his first two seasons at Pittodrie but the goals dried up last term and he only struck twice in 10 months before his recent spree."A striker scoring goals is a lot happier and feels like a lot better player than a striker that's not scoring," said Vernon."It's good for my confidence. Early on in the season I wasn't playing as much as I would have liked. I managed to get a chance and do the business and get a few goals."I'm not looking to rest on my laurels and kick on and get more goals now."
