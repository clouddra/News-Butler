    Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain moved above Monaco at the top of Ligue 1 with a 4-0 win over Bastia.
    Laurent Blanc's side had started the day behind Monaco in the table.
    But Sweden striker Ibrahimovic twice found the net in the opening 13 minutes to give the hosts a commanding lead.
    Edinson Cavani added a third goal before the 26-year-old Uruguay international completed the scoring with an 89th-minute penalty.
    Monaco could return to the top of the table if they win away at Sochaux on Sunday.
    Ibrahimovic, 32, had 
    
been a doubt 

     after injuring his thigh during last Friday's World Cup qualifier against Austria and then missed Tuesday's 5-3 loss to Germany. 
    But he was an influential presence and has now scored six times in his last four appearances for club and country.
