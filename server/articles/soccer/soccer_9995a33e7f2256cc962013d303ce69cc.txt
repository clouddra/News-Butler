    Manager Paul Lambert is "happy with Aston Villa's progress", despite a 
    
2-0 home Premier League defeat 

     to Tottenham.
    Andros Townsend gave Tottenham the lead with a first half free-kick which eluded everyone to find the far corner and Roberto Soldado made sure of all three points with a well-taken effort in the second half.
    Villa have failed to keep a Premier League clean sheet at home since December 2012 and are 
    
13th 

     in the table.
