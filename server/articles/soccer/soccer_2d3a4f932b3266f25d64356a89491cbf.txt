Torquay United boss Alan Knill was disappointed but not dismayed by the defeat at Burton Albion.Knill saw his injury-ravaged team lose 2-0 on Tuesday night as second-half goals from Jimmy Phillips and Adam McGurk gave Albion only a second home win of the season in Sky Bet League Two.Knill said: "I thought we did okay, but then got beat by two poor goals from our point of view."I didn't think there was too much in it and, overall, I thought we did a decent job."We knew it was going to be difficult but didn't think we looked in too much danger, but then we conceded on the counter attack, which wasn't a great goal, and then we conceded another poor one."We were at their end of the pitch and the next minute the ball was in the back of our net. But that's how it is at the moment, but we just have to get through this period."We're missing two centre-halves and we need to get them back. But we did compete against what I think is one of the best teams in the league."The ground was deadly quiet and we did what we wanted to do, which was to get people behind the ball and make things difficult for Burton."But you can't switch off because they've got good players at the top end of the pitch."
