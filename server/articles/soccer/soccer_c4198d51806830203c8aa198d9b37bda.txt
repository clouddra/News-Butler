This was revealed by an MRI scan on Tuesday morning. The attacker is expected to be out for four to six weeks."Bojan, who has also played for Roma and AC Milan, has returned to Catalonia for treatment.Ajax lost their Champions League Group H opener 4-0 to Barca a fortnight ago and meet Milan on Tuesday night.Their form in the Eredivisie has been inconsistent although they lie in fifth place, a point behind joint leaders FC Twente, PSV Eindhoven and Heerenveen.
