Patrick Ebert: Late equaliser for ValladolidSevilla squandered a two-goal lead as Real Valladolid hit back to claim a 2-2 Primera Division draw with two goals in three minutes, leaving Unai Emery's side still searching for their first win on the road since September 2012.The visitors appeared on course for a regulation victory when they eased into a 2-0 lead inside half an hour through Carlos Bocca and Alberto Moreno.However, they were shocked by goals in the 81st and 84th minutes from Mateus Manucho and Patrick Ebert as the hosts somehow clawed their way back into a game Sevilla had completely dominated.Sevilla went ahead with less than 90 seconds gone when Andujar Coke held the ball up, took control and laid the ball off for Bacca, who curled a shot into the corner to leave the goalkeeper with no chance at all.The hosts looked to hit back. Ebert failed to keep his volley down after an inch-perfect cross from Zakarya Bergdich on the left and the shot went into the ground and wide.Bergdich then ballooned the ball over but it was Sevilla who came close again, Bacca unleashing a swerving shot from distance which Diego Marino had to leap to his right to parry.Bacca then shot across goal and it was no real surprise when Sevilla doubled their lead after half an hour.Vicente Iborra delivered a corner from the left which Valladolid could not clear and the ball was hooked back into the box with Moreno pouncing on the loose ball and sending a low, fierce shot into the left-hand corner of the goal.Sevilla continued to dominate after the break with Bacca firing over in the six-yard box before the same player ran at the Valladolid defence, only for his shot to be deflected wide for a corner.The hosts tried to make a breakthrough and with 10 minutes remaining Manucho halved the deficit, out-jumping his defender to power his header into the corner from Carlos Pena's cross from the left.And their comeback was complete three minutes later when Ebert curled a free-kick over the wall and into the corner of the net, giving the keeper no chance.
