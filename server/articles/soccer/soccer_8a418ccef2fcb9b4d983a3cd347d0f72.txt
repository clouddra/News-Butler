West Ham United midfielder Mark Noble believes he can break into Roy Hodgson's England World Cup squad.Noble, who captained the Under-21 side, has yet to win a senior cap but is refusing to give up hope of gatecrashing Hodgson's party for next summer's finals in Brazil.The 26-year-old has been a consistent performer for West Ham and he believes he could make the step up for England if he got a call."I believe I am good enough," Noble told the London Evening Standard."I have seen the players we have had here who have been in the England set-up and I believe that if I made that step up, I would be able to mentally and physically cope with it."I'm not going around shouting that I should be in the squad and all that because I am not that sort of person."I have obviously played in the Premier League week in, week out, since I was about 19 and played at a good level."If it happens, it happens, but I am just going to keep on enjoying my football, getting on the ball, enjoying passing and creating stuff and if it happens, it happens."
