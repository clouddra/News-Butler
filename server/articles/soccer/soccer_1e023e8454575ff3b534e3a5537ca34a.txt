Bury may delve into the loan market again as caretaker boss Ronnie Jepson tries to get the out of the League Two relegation zone.The Shakers lost 3-1 to fellow strugglers Torquay on Saturday and slipped down to 22nd, just two points and one place above Accrington, who currently occupy one of the bottom two positions.Jepson, recently placed in caretaker charge until January following the sacking of Kevin Blackwell, is unlikely to renew the loan of Wigan full-back Jordan Mustoe to free up space for more new recruits.Mustoe's month-long stay at Gigg Lane is up and Jepson, who also has Danny Hylton, Shaun Beeley, Anton Forrester and Danny Mayor on borrowed deals, knows he cannot have more than five loanees in his matchday squad."We've got five loans there and we can only have five on the team-sheet," said Jepson."I'll assess that. I might have somebody in mind to bring in."In an ideal world we'd like it if it was January first and you can move things around, but it's not and I don't want that to be an excuse. We'll do with what we've got at the minute."Should the Shakers do any business this week, Jepson would like it to be concluded quickly."We'll speak to clubs, we'll have a look at one or two situations and we'll see where we go from there," he added."You can only go with what you've got. If it was January first it would be different because you're looking at a different market; you're not looking at a loan market."There might be people available on frees or for a small fee but we can't do that, the only option we've got now is loans."
