We had to get through that period."David Ball's was a fantastic finish and Jon Parkin adding one before the break was just what we needed."It's a great win against a good side."Town opened the scoring six minutes before the break.It was a neat counter-attack from Fleetwood, with Liam Hogan laying the ball on for David Ball to produce a sublime finish from 20 yards.Fleetwood doubled their advantage before half-time.
