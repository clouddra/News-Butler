Northampton boss Aidy Boothroyd was disappointed his men conceded two goals in quick succession as they drew 2-2 with Dagenham.Captain Ian Morris popped up to rescue a point for Cobblers at Sixfields where Burnett saw his side come from behind to get their noses in front only to be pegged back in the second half.Brentford's on-loan striker Luke Norris broke the deadlock on his Northampton debut but two goals quickly turned the game in the visitors' favour. Zavon Hines equalised and Rhys Murphy put them in front only for Morris to intervene and ensure the spoils were shared."I was quite pleased with how we played in the first half an hour of the game; we only limited them to a couple of chances, if that," said Boothroyd."We played some good stuff and were exactly what I want us to be. The goal from Hines is a very good goal and we probably won't get another one like that for a while."For the second one we're sort of feeling sorry for ourselves really and it's another one right before half-time. We're conceding in pockets and there are enough senior players on the pitch to make sure we keep a 1-0 scoreline at 1-0."If they got everything right they wouldn't be here but we showed good character and spirit to come back from 2-1 down and score again, against a side that are very good on the counter-attack, we had to be brave to do that."
