Kenny Jackett was delighted to cash in on slip-ups by the top two as his side ground out a 2-0 win against Oldham.Second half-goals from James Henry - his first for the club after his arrival on-loan from Millwall - and Leigh Griffiths earned Wolves a ninth win in 11 league games.They are now just three points behind Orient, who were beaten by Coventry, and Peterborough, who drew with Sheffield United, with a game in hand.Jackett said: "In the end you have to concentrate on your own performances and your own team."But when you are looking at the top two, they have had such a fantastic run."We have lost one game in 12 now and that is a good solid start to the season that is keeping us in pace with the top of the table"But we have now got to look forward to a very big game at Bradford on Saturday. They do come thick and fast so our concentration after a good win has to turn quickly to that match."The game against Oldham was played in torrential rain for long spells in the first-half andJ ackett was pleased with the way that his players coped with the greasy surface.He added: "We upped the tempo in the second-half and made several chances and I was pleased with the goals."We talked about putting the ball in hard and low on this type of surface and that is very difficult for defenders to handle."We did that and got the goals that took us away. I was very pleased with the clean sheet as well. It gives you a basis to work from."The only disappointment for Jackett was that right-back Matt Doherty limped off in the first half with a potentially troublesome hamstring strain."We just hope that it is not too bad," admitted Jackett. "He has been a very good player for us so far this season. I don't know how long he will be out for."If we want to get promoted we will need to work hard to keep as many players fit as possible and particularly out better players."Wolves could have been in control by half-time if it had not been for Oldham goalkeeper Mark Oxley.Oxley did well to punch away a fierce Bakary Sako free-kick in the 27th minute and on the stroke of half-time he turned a 20 yard drive from Henry around the post.But Oxley was out of luck when Henry broke the deadlock - losing control of a Sako cross and then seeing the ball roll over the line off Henry.There was nothing he could to stop Griffiths grabbing his ninth goal of the season though when the Scotland international let fly from the edge of the area following a pass from Sako in the 66th minute.
