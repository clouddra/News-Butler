Thibault Giresse takes on Daniel WassGuingamp came from behind to secure their first Ligue 1 away win of the season with a 2-1 victory in Evian.Despite falling behind to a first-half Nicolas Benezet strike, Jocelyn Gourvennec's men hit back with goals in the second half from Thibault Giresse and Ladislas Douniama in what was the first Ligue 1 meeting between the two sides.Defeat for Evian leaves them without a win in five games and just two points ahead of third-bottom Lorient.It was the visitors who started the brighter and Evian goalkeeper Jesper Hansen was called upon twice inside the opening 20 minutes.Firstly, Douniama tested the palms of the Danish shot-stopper with an effort from 20 yards before Claudio Beauvue's strike from a Giresse delivery was turned away for a corner.Evian responded through Olivier Sorlin but the former Rennes midfielder saw his effort confidently saved by Guy N'Dy before Pascal Dupraz's men took the lead just before the 25 minute mark.Benezet picked the ball up 20 yards out and played a clever one-two with Kevin Berigaud before opening his right-foot to place the ball beyond N'Dy for the opening goal of the game.Hansen was called upon once again 10 minutes before the break when Sankoh crossed from the right but Douniama's resulting shot was turned away once again by the hosts' keeper and Evian's lead remained intact at the interval.The game sprung into life once again with 15 minutes left to play following an uneventful opening to the second-half.Firstly the visitors drew level when Steven Langil released Reynald Lemaitre down the left and he picked out Giresse perfectly at the penalty spot to leave Hansen no chance with a left-footed finish.Buoyed on by that goal, Guingamp continued to press and completed a turnaround just three minutes later.Langil was involved again and this time he played a great ball into the area with the outside of his foot which Douniama met with his head to beat Hansen and send the visitors into the lead for the first time in the game.Evian were unable to find the equaliser as Guingamp's good start to the season continued.
