Chesterfield boss Paul Cook admits on-loan Sheffield United striker Chris Porter is unlikely to feature for the Spireites again.Cook borrowed Porter on a month-long deal at the beginning of October when he was short of options up front with Marc Richards and Armand Gnanduillet injured.Those two players are fit and available again now, though, and Cook admits Porter will probably not feature again for the League Two promotion hopefuls before his stay at the Proact Stadium ends next week."Chris Porter was brought in as a short-term fix to what we've already got," Cook said."Armand and Marc Richards were out injured and Eoin Doyle was expecting a child. Now all three of them are available again, they obviously come into my thinking ahead of Chris."It's likely that Chris won't be involved at the weekend but then he has one more week with us and if anything was to happen then it presents an opportunity for him to play."If that doesn't happen, though, then it's going to make it difficult for us to give him game time."Porter has made four appearances for Chesterfield, starting the Johnstone's Paint Trophy win at Mansfield and the league games against Fleetwood and Burton.
