Morgan Sanson in action for Montpellier.Substitute Djamel Bakar snatched a deserved 1-1 draw for Montpellier in the final minute on Sunday afternoon to deny fourth-placed Nantes victory at the Stade de la Mosson.Filip Dordevic's 22nd-minute goal had looked set to be enough to hand Jean Fernandez's promoted side their sixth win in the last seven matches in all competitions, but Bakar's last-gasp leveller salvaged a point for MHSC.The result left the visitors eight points behind Ligue 1 leaders Paris St Germain and extended 2012 champions Montpellier's cushion over the relegation zone to five points after 12 games.The hosts had the first real chance of the game when Benjamin Stambouli released Remy Cabella in the sixth minute but, with only Nantes goalkeeper Remy Riou to beat, his strong right-footed shot was saved.Sixteen minutes later the deadlock was broken at the other end, Jordan Veretout's cross eluding attempted target Issa Cissokho but falling for Dordevic to fire between defender Daniel Congre and goalkeeper Geoffrey Jourdren.Riou had to be alert soon after to preserve his side's lead, tipping Cabella's effort around the post for a corner after the midfielder had again been set up by Stambouli.Souleymane Camara was next to turn provider for Cabella on the stroke of half-time. On this occasion the goalkeeper was helpless but the lob drifted inches wide.Montpellier will have considered themselves unfortunate to head in at the break trailing, but continued on the front foot when the second half kicked off and went within a whisker in the 47th minute when Abdelhamid El Kaoutari's fierce left-footed strike from Cabella's assist flew narrowly over the bar.Nantes were struggling to make an impact going forward but could have doubled their advantage in the 73rd minute, Dordevic's chip brushing the top of the bar on its way over with the keeper beaten.Substitute Anthony Mounier then teed up Camara for a near-post header which was again just off target seven minutes from time but, just when it seemed Montpellier's pursuit of an equaliser was going to be in vain, it arrived.Teddy Mezague burst down the left and crossed for Bakar, who got the better of defender Oswaldo Vizcarrondo and dispatched a right-footed shot past Riou.Montpellier could even have won it deep into stoppage time, but Riou pulled off a miraculous save to keep out Camara's header from a brilliant Cabella cross.
