Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy has refused to rule himself out of the running for the vacant Republic of Ireland manager's job.McCarthy, who played and managed the Republic, has emerged as the favourite to succeed Giovanni Trapattoni as the country's new boss.Trapattoni was axed last month after the Republic lost to Sweden and Austria to end their chances of reaching next summer's World Cup finals.McCarthy has left the door open to an approach from the Football Association of Ireland after conceding he might like to be asked about the job."I'm not ruling myself in or out," said McCarthy. "It might be that I'd just like to be asked so I can say yes. It might be that I'd just like to be asked so I can say no. I haven't been asked."I love being here, I love my job, I really do love being here."I'm not asking for it, I'm not courting it, I'm not trying to do anything with it."
