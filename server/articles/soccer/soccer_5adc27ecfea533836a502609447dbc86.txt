Brazil international Hulk claims to be feeling settled at Zenit St Petersburg despite ongoing speculation regarding his future.The burly frontman was strongly linked with a move to England during the summer transfer window, with the likes of Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur reported to have been on his trail for some time.No move was agreed, though, with sizeable loan fees said to have been demanded by Zenit for their Samba star.For now then, Hulk remains in Russia - where he has spent the past 12 months after completing a big-money switch from Porto.It came as something of a surprise when the 27-year-old agreed a switch to Zenit, given the interest in him from elsewhere, but he insists he is happy and fully adjusted to his new surroundings.Hulk told Zenit Press Service: "I feel free in myself here."We can walk in the local parks with my wife and children without any kind of pressure from journalists or football fans. There are Brazilian restaurants here, but we also enjoy Russian cuisine."The only thing which caused me some discomfort was the cold weather in winter. But the city looks beautiful in winter when everything is covered with snow."
