Bolton Wanderers are reportedly set to win the race for Australian defender Trent Sainsbury.According to sources in Australia, Central Coast Mariners have accepted an offer of Â£350,000 for the 21-year-old, who played a key role in helping the Mariners clinch the A-League Premiership this season.Southampton are also interested in the defender's services but were only willing to offer a trial before committing to a permanent deal.Club chairman Peter Turnbull confirmed that the Aussie youth international is almost certain to leave the A-League after his performances this term."We've had a couple of enquiries about Trent, but I think everyone needs to remember that Marco Rojas, the player of the year, has left Melbourne Victory, and Terry Antonis has left Sydney FC," he said in the Illawara Mercury."Trent is under contract for next season but there's been some solid expressions of interest from overseas clubs."It's just a fact of life, and given we're the club who produce the most young players, we're the ones who get most of the enquiries."
