Mainz winger Nicolai Muller would be willing to sign another contract, but is keen to play European football at some stage of his career.Muller has a further two years left on his current deal, but was linked with a summer move to Bayer Leverkusen following Andre Schurrle's departure for Chelsea.The 26-year-old, who made his Germany debut in May against Ecuador, has enjoyed an impressive start to the Bundesliga season after scoring six goals in eight appearances.Speculation has claimed that Muller is wanted by clubs in the Bundesliga and across Europe, and the attacker is unsure about his long-term future."There is definitely a chance of me signing one more deal at Mainz," Muller told Sport-BILD weekly."It's still the club that handed me the chance to feature in the top flight."It's a good club, but basically I would enjoy playing in European club competitions on a regular basis."Muller joined Mainz from Greuther Furth in 2011 after previously being ditched by Eintracht Frankfurt as a teenager.He added: "I am happy to have made it as a Bundesliga player after all."I was dropped by Eintracht Frankfurt as a 16-year-old since they felt I would turn out to be too slim. I knew I had to try out at other clubs and therefore joined Greuther Furth."
