Hellas Verona coach Andrea Mandorlini believes his team are reaping the rewards from four years of hard work.Verona beat Parma 3-2 on Sunday to clinch their fifth win of the campaign and climb to fourth in Serie A.The Mastini, who gained promotion to the top flight this summer after finishing runners-up in the second tier, have lost just twice this season."This is the fourth year that I'm in Verona," Mandorlini told Gazzetta dello Sport. "Hence, it all started a while back."The team spirit is always the same regardless of the fact that other players have arrived. Now we are collecting the fruits of our labour."We are very happy with our position in the table and we certainly didn't expect it."We just need to enjoy the moment because we are going above our expectations."We hope this will last long."Verona travel to the San Siro to face Inter Milan on Saturday.
