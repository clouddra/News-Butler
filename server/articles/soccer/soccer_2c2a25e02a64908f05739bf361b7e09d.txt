Jermain Defoe says Tottenham's clash with Hull this weekend is a "must-win" match as they look to stay in touch at the top of the Premier League.Hull arrive having given some of Spurs' title rivals a run for their money already this season, and they will have former Spurs star Tom Huddlestone in the centre of their midfield.The 26-year-old spent eight seasons at White Hart Lane but chose to leave in the summer in search of first-team football."We're all looking forward to seeing him," Defoe said of Huddlestone, who could play Spurs again in Hull's Capital One Cup tie in midweek."He was a great player here and is doing well for Hull, pulling strings and stuff. It is going to be a tough game but it is a game we have to win.

To be up there is great," he said."One more goal I will be on the top on my own, and to have someone around you like Martin Chivers is special."What will be the outcome in the match Spurs vs Hull?
