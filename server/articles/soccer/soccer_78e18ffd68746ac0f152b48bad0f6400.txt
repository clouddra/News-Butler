Karleigh Osborne says it was an easy choice to step down a division and link up with Bristol City on a short-term loan.The defender has taken the decision to spend time in League One after struggling for game time at Championship outfit Millwall.The 25-year-old centre-half has made just one first team outing for the Lions this season and admits he jumped at the chance to get regular football at Ashton Gate.He told the Bristol Post: "I've no problem with dropping down to League One, I just want to get some games in."I've played plenty of games in this division before and I know what it's all about."It's a difficult division to get out of and it takes a lot of hard work. Your mentality has to be strong and the character has to be right."There are already some good characters at Bristol City and, judging by what I've seen on the training field, there are also some good footballers here."On City's standing just one place off the bottom of League One, Osborne added: "The way the boys pass the ball and move it about is top gear and I'm surprised they are where they are in the table."Once it all clicks together, I think they'll be fine. There are still a lot of games to play, there is still a lot of time left in the season and I'm sure things will turn around."Obviously, the quicker that happens, the better."
