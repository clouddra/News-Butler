FIFA has begun disciplinary action against the English and Polish Football Associations over the use of flares at Wembley this month.Lit flares were clearly visible in the visiting supporters' section before and during England's 2-0 World Cup qualifying win on October 15.But, as the host Association, the English FA is held responsible for what happens within Wembley on match days.And both organisations now face the possibility of sanctions once FIFA's investigations are complete.A statement from FIFA read: "As the proceedings are ongoing, please understand that we cannot comment further."
