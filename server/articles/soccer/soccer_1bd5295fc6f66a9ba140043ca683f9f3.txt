    Southampton player and Kenya national team captain Victor Wanyama tells Football Focus 
    
about how he was affected by the Nairobi terror attack.
    Wanyama first heard of 
    
the attack at the Westgate shopping centre 

     during a pre-match meal in a Liverpool hotel. He admits that he doesn't know how he "managed to finish the game" 
    
at Anfield 

     that day while awaiting news of family and friends.

At least 67 people died 

     when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Nairobi shopping centre on 21 September. Kenya's international matches were called off last week as a mark of respect.
