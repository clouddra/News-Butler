    Manchester United manager David Moyes says "missed opportunities" cost his team victory in their 
    
1-1 home draw against Southampton.
    United took the lead through Robin van Persie and hit the crossbar twice, but Southampton's Adam Lallana scored a late equaliser to claim a point at Old Trafford. 
    The draw leaves United eight points adrift of Premier League leaders Arsenal.
