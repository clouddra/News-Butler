Former Rangers captain Fernando Ricksen has been diagnosed with motor neurone disease.Ricksen revealed on a live Dutch television programme on Wednesday night that he had the rare life-threatening condition.The 37-year-old broke down in tears when he was asked by the presenter why he was talking so slowly.Ricksen, struggling to control his emotions, asked the author of his book to explain that he had been diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, which is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.ALS is the most common of the five motor neurone diseases with a life expectancy of less than five years for about half of those diagnosed with the condition.It is a debilitating disease, characterised by rapidly progressive weakness, and muscle atrophy that leads to difficulty in speaking, swallowing and breathing.Holding back the tears, Ricksen, who played for Rangers from 2000 to 2006, said: "The medical people have said my condition could worsen quickly. I do not know anymore."Rangers manager Ally McCoist was shocked by the news and offered Ricksen all of the club's support."This is truly devasting news and the thoughts of everyone associated with Rangers Football Club are with Fernando," McCoist said on the club's website.
