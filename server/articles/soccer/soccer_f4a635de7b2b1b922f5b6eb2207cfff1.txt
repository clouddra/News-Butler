Malmo have rejected bids from a host of clubs including Middlesbrough and Bournemouth for Tokelo Rantie.The highly-rated South African striker is under a long-term deal at Malmo having joined initially on loan from Orlando Pirates before the move became permanent in April.Rantie's progress has not gone unnoticed and a number of clubs have shown an interest.Sky Sports understands that Middlesbrough, Bournemouth and St Etienne have all seen bids in excess of one million euros rejected.Indeed Boro boss Tony Mowbray was understood to have been in Sweden on Sunday to see Rantie in action against AIK Stockholm.However, Malmo - who are half way through their season - are battling for the Swedish title and do not wish to sell, and their domestic transfer deadline has also passed meaning they could not sign a replacement if they did sell."Malmo want Champions League football, and that makes any deal very hard," a source close to the club told Sky Sports."Malmo want to keep Rantie and it appears they will at this point.Malmo refused to discuss any potential deal about Rantie, and a club spokesman Per Welinder said: "As a members club we don't talk about transfers."We cannot talk about Rantie or any speculation regarding him. We can say that the transfer window has now passed and it is something we are not happy about but other clubs in the league pushed this through without thinking."
