    James Forrest's stunning equaliser against tenacious Hibernian prevented stuttering Celtic suffering their first domestic defeat of the season.
    Celtic were left angry as Paul Heffernan fired the 18th-minute opener after a rebound fell to the striker in an offside position.
    The Premiership leaders struggled to break down an Edinburgh side who were mainly operating on the break.
    But Forrest's beautiful curling drive levelled the game with 13 minutes left.
    It was a cruel moment for Hibs, who have now only lost once in their last nine games, as they had been reduced to 10 men at the time with Ryan McGivern off the field receiving treatment.
    However, Celtic deserved at least a point despite being far below their best with perhaps one collective eye on Tuesday's Champions League visit by Ajax.

The big talking point at kick-off was the Celtic debut handed to Darnell Fisher, the 19-year-old Englishman who signed in 2011 after leaving Farnborough covering at right-back in the absence of injured duo Adam Matthews and Mikael Lustig.
    A virus picked up on international duty meant Emilio Izaguirre was missing from the other side of defence, with Charlie Mulgrew dropping back to cover and Beram Kayal coming into midfield.
    Izaguirre and Lustig are expected to be fit for a midweek return, but Fisher did not look out of place as he slotted in comfortably and impressively into the Celtic system as the visitors enjoyed more of the early possession.
