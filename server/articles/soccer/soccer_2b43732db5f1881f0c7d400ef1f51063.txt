    Motherwell retained third place in the Scottish Premiership after coming from behind to beat bottom club Hearts.
    The home side spurned several chances and they were punished when Ryan Stevenson fired the ball past Gunnar Nielsen with a fine finish.
    However, a right-footed strike from 19-year-old striker Craig Moore levelled the match shortly after.
    And a late header from defender Shaun Hutchinson clinched the win for Stuart McCall's side.
    While the home side maintained their status in the table, the visitors saw the gap between them and second-bottom side Kilmarnock, who defeated Ross County, increase to 13 points.

    The home side were first to have a sight of goal as former Hearts striker John Sutton's header drifted wide of target.
    Stuart McCall's side were dominating possession but the Hearts rearguard were standing firm and denying the Motherwell strikers room in front of goal.
    As the game edged towards half-time Motherwell had a number of chances to take the lead. 
    Iain Vigurs twice had shots on goal saved by Jamie MacDonald before the midfielder set up Sutton 12 yards out, but, once again, MacDonald saved with ease.
    Nielsen had been a virtual spectator in the Motherwell goal but was called into action in the last minute of the half.
    Jamie Walker found himself clean through, but the Faroese keeper dived low to his left to deny the teenager and, although David Smith pounced on the rebound, his effort was deflected over the crossbar.
    Motherwell started the second half on the front foot and, within two minutes of the restart, Sutton had headed inches wide and then forced MacDonald to tip a header over.

    However, the visitors were dangerous on the break, and Walker will be disappointed with his effort on goal after Jamie Hamill had dispossessed Keith Lasley.
    There was always a chance that Motherwell would rue the opportunities they had and, after 62 minutes, the visitors took a shock lead.
    Stevenson collected the ball 30 yards out and, after a couple of stepovers, he fired in a shot that went underneath the body of the diving Nielsen and into the net.
    This sent the 1500 visiting Hearts fans into raptures of delight.
    However, their delight lasted only five minutes. Stuart McCall brought on Moore and, with his first touch of the ball, he fired in an equaliser.
    A long through ball was knocked down by Brad McKay, but Moore was first to react and sent a terrific shot high into the roof of the net.
    It was the least the home side deserved after passing up a number of good chances early on.
    The home side pressed for a winner and the pressure paid off with seven minutes left to play. 
    Vigurs swung in a corner from the right and Hutchinson leapt high above the Hearts defence to send a glancing header into the back of the net.
