Barcelona have left the door open to a move for Borussia Monchengladbach's highly-rated keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.Some media outlets in Spain claimed that the La Liga champions had cooled their interest in the 21-year-old.Ter Stegen has been touted in some quarters as a long-term replacement for Barca's current keeper Victor Valdes, whose contract expires at the end of this season.Former Barca keeper Andoni Zubizarreta, now the club's technical director, confirmed he had recently visited Germany and insisted their search for a successor to Valdes was ongoing."It is true that I was in Germany, because we are working on some subjects, but this operation is not closed," Zubizarreta, capped 126 times by Spain, told Canal Plus TV Spain."I recognise that many keepers are of interest, but it is not easy to find a man with the right characteristics to replace Victor Valdes."Barcelona never speak about chances for the squad, but we still have enough time until July 2014."
