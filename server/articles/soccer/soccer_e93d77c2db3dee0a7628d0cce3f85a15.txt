Hertha Berlin goalkeeper Thomas Kraft is keen to open contract negotiations during the forthcoming winter break.The 25-year-old signed a four-year deal when he moved to the Olympiastadion in 2011, having come to the end of his contract with Bayern Munich.A series of high-profile mistakes, coupled with Bayern's desire to sign Manuel Neuer from Schalke, led to Kraft's departure from the Allianz Arena but he has established himself in the German capital in the two years since.Hertha currently lie in seventh in the Bundesliga, and Kraft wants to help the club kick on."The club and I have agreed to pick up contract talks when the winter break comes. I am well able to imagine a stay at the club beyond the end of my current deal," he said."Our start to the season, and those results we have been achieving has increased my willingness to stay on."
