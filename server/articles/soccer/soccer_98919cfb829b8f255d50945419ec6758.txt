Robin van Persie is expected to be fit to return to the Manchester United side against Stoke on Saturday.PA PhotosRobin van Persie has impressed at Old Trafford since arriving last year.The Netherlands international missed the 1-0 Champions League win over Real Sociedad with groin and toe injuries but manager David Moyes is confident he should be able to face the Potters.-  Payne: Settled defence- Jolly: Old stagersJavier Hernandez, who deputised for Van Persie as Wayne Rooney’s partner in attack on Wednesday, could make way for the United top scorer but Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley, who were not involved against Sociedad, are doubts for Moyes.He told a news conference: "Robin has a good chance. He's had problems with his toes and a little bit with his groin as well, but I think he should be OK. He’s had a little bit of training as well.“Everybody’s improving and the only one who’s a doubt at the moment is Danny Welbeck, who has some fluid on his knee. Tom Cleverley is still recovering from his calf but overall we're pretty strong."United are also waiting to see if centre-backs Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, who have sat out the last two games, will be ready to return.Marouane Fellaini is available, having delayed surgery on a wrist injury, but Moyes said the 27.5 million pound midfielder is inconvenienced by playing in a cast.He added: "It's never easy when you have an injury that needs something doing to it. People who play football will tell you that you use your hands and arms quite a lot for balance and pushing off, so it can be awkward when you’ve got an injury. But he is fine, he’s getting used to it now and hopefully he can play even in the condition he’s in."
