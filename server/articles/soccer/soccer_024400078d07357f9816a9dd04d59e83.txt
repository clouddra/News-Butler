Bournemouth chairman Eddie Mitchell is reluctant to discuss the club's interest in Tokelo Rantie, but admits money is available for squad strengthening.The Cherries are reported to have already seen two offers for much sought-after Malmo striker Rantie knocked back, but are said to be readying a third approach.Sky Sports revealed on Monday that the 22-year-old is generating plenty of interest, with Middlesbrough and St Etienne also believed to be keen on the South Africa international.If Bournemouth are to see off the opposition and secure Rantie's signature they will need to act quickly, but Mitchell says the club will be playing their transfer cards close to their chest.He told the Daily Echo: "I know we are still looking to add to our strike force. It is about finding the right person, somebody who can add something else."Asked if the necessary funds are available to boss Eddie Howe, Mitchell added: "We wouldn't be looking if there weren't."We are not on a time-wasting mission. We are seriously looking and that would indicate there are funds available."
