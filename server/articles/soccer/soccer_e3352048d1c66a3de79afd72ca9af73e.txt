Pep Guardiola: Not underestimating PlzenBayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola has warned his side not to under-estimate Viktoria Plzen, despite beating the Czech club 5-0 a fortnight ago.That result will only complicate matters when the sides meet at the Struncovy Sady Stadion on Tuesday night, according to the Catalan, whose team will be aiming to wrap up their place in the Champions League knockout stage with a win."I'm sure it's going to be harder for us than it was in Munich," Guardiola said at a press conference on Monday. "When you lose a game as a player, then you definitely want to do better in the return leg."We want to qualify tomorrow, but we also want to win the group, which means we want to win in Moscow (against CSKA) and against (Manchester) City too."

The Bavarian outfit can equal Guardiola's former club Barcelona's run of nine wins in a row in Europe's elite club competition, although that is the least of the 42-year-old's concerns."Records are good for the club and these clubs, the best in the world, try to win them, but the record we want is the one attached to winning the title next May," he said.By lifting the trophy in Lisbon, Bayern would become the first side in the modern Champions League era to defend their title successfully.Mario Gotze, who was on the losing Borussia Dortmund side in last May's final, knows it is not going to be easy, but he is confident enough of reaching the last 16.

"When you get into the knockout stage, then it comes down to minor things," he said."Trivialities can make the difference. Whether you play for Dortmund or for Bayern, it's the same."We just want to qualify for the next stage as soon as we can. We've got many, many games coming up in the next few weeks so it would be easier if we could go into the next Champions League games having already qualified."Guardiola has ruled Arjen Robben out of Tuesday's encounter due to a persistent groin strain while Javi Martinez is unlikely to start, despite coming through 90 minutes on his return to action at the weekend.Plzen bounced back from their 5-0 defeat in Munich with a 6-1 win over Jablonec at the weekend, rising to second in the Czech Gambrinus Liga as a result and gaining some self-belief ahead of a crucial fixture.Defeat would eliminate them from the Champions League if Manchester City pick up at least a point against CSKA Moscow, leaving them also with only minimal chances of clinching third in the group and a place in the Europa League.
