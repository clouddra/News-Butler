Roma coach Rudi Garcia preferred to focus on the positives after his team saw their perfect run halted in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Torino.The Giallorossi went into the game in Turin looking to make it 11 wins in a row in Serie A.However, former Roma striker Alessio Cerci cancelled out Kevin Strootman's opener to deny the Giallorossi all three points."This is football and we can't win them all," Garcia said to Gazzetta dello Sport."A draw away from home is not a bad result."I liked that we played because even at the end, we went forward looking for the winner."The outcome left Roma three points clear of nearest rivals Napoli and Juventus, who won their respective games at the weekend, and face each other this Sunday."We must make the most of this point, as it is valuable," Garcia said."We now must prepare and be ready to win our next game at home to Sassuolo."I hope we can then break away from Juventus or Napoli, maybe even both."Garcia does not believe the pressure of winning got to his players.The Romans went into the encounter knowing that an 11th consecutive victory would equal the best ever start to a season by any team - Tottenham in the 1960-61 season - in the top five European leagues."Was the winning streak starting to weigh on us? It was not a weight for us," Garcia said."With three games a week, the third one was always going to be difficult."Obviously without (injured strikers) Francesco Totti and Gervinho we have fewer options in attack."But we still played well and I cannot fault my players."Garcia has reason to be pleased with his side having the best attack and defence in Italy's top flight with 25 goals scored and two goals conceded.
