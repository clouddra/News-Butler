    Ian Holloway says he is leaving his position as Crystal Palace manager because seven defeats in eight Premier League games is not good enough.

Holloway has departed by mutual consent 

     after less than a year in charge at Selhurst Park and with only one victory this season. 
    The 50-year-old former Blackpool boss says he would like Palace to find a manager with more Premier League experience.
