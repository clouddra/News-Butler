Atletico Madrid striker Adrian Lopez is full of praise for Diego Costa's part in his side's good start to the season.Costa and fellow front man David Villa fired Atletico to a 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Sunday, a win that sees them remain in second place in La Liga, just one point behind leaders Barcelona.13 goals from Costa have inspired Diego Simeone's side, who have lost just once this season."Diego Costa is spectacular at his best," declared Lopez in the latest edition of the Spanish monthly FHM. "He has a good shot, he is fast but he knows how to play for the team. He deserves everything he is getting at the moment."Lopez is pleased with his recovery from a fractured cheekbone sustained in Atletico's Champions League meeting with Zenit St Petersburg in September."I'm very excited. The break allowed my face to heal very well."The 25-year-old is also keen to credit coach Simeone, nicknamed Cholo, for Atletico's good form, which follows on from their Copa Del Rey triumph over Real Madrid in May and their third-place finish in La Liga."The players have to be at their best from early on. That is something that Cholo insists on, from the early minutes we have to play at our best level."Linked with a move to Arsenal early in 2013, Lopez is very happy with his situation at the Vicente Calderon."I feel loved by my team-mates, and the coach gives me a lot of confidence. Atletico is something very special, and I have felt that from the first day I arrived."
