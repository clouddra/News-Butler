    Manchester United boss David Moyes admits it has taken time to "settle in" at the club after his side 
    
defeat Fulham 3-1 

     to extend their unbeaten run to seven games in all competitions.
    Man Utd scored three goals in 13 first-half minutes through Antonio Valencia, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney before Fulham responded via Alex Kacanicklic's deflected shot.
    Moyes replaced Sir Alex Ferguson as United boss before the start of the season, but has come under pressure following the club's 
    
worst start to a league season in 24 years.
