Miroslav Klose has hinted that he might leave Lazio when his contract expires in the summer and could return to the club where he started his career, Kaiserslautern.The 36-year-old has enjoyed two productive seasons with the Biancoceleste, while he is only one goal away from breaking Gerd Muller's all-time scoring record for Germany.Injury has prevented him from appearing more frequently this season, or challenging for Muller's record, but he has no intention of ending his playing days in the summer."I have two offers from the States and I could return to Kaiserslautern where I started my career," Klose told the Gazzetta dello Sport."I will make up my mind in the next few months."Klose has scored only once for Lazio this season, although he has only made four appearances due to injury.He has scored 29 times in Serie A, averaging almost a goal per game since arriving from Bayern Munich two years ago, while he is level on 68 goals with Muller for Germany.Germany coach Joachim Low has already made it clear that, if fit and in form, Klose will be part of his plans for next summer's World Cup.
