Swindon manager Mark Cooper could not hide his frustration despite seeing his side's 2-0 win at home to Notts County.Two goals in the space of 17 first-half minutes from Nile Ranger and Dany N'Guessan were enough to earn Cooper's high-fliers a fourth successive win.But the home side missed a host of chances to make the win even more emphatic, with Nathan Byrne twice striking the post.Swindon were almost made to pay for those wasted opportunities when they conceded a late penalty only for County striker Danny Haynes to blaze his spot-kick over the bar.Cooper said: "We played really well and passed the ball with focus and dealt with them well, although it's frustrating we didn't kill it off properly."For the possession we had we should have been more in control because if they had scored the penalty it would have been game on."It's natural when it's 2-0 that it becomes tense, but we saw it out."They were all good and Nathan Byrne could have had two or three goals himself, but we don't pick individuals out and we focus on the team."We have more security at the back, not whereas if we made a mistake at the back they might be in one-on-one, but with that extra defender we've been able to sure it up and still maintain our attacking threat."
