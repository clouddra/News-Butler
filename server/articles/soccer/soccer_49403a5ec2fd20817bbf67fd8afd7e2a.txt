Fulham manager Martin Jol has warned his players that they cannot travel to face Crystal Palace on Monday believing all three points are guaranteed.The Cottagers are outside the relegation zone on goal difference only and travel to face Ian Holloway's men who have only four points from their first seven games."They (Crystal Palace) need the points as well and it's the Barclays Premier League, so it will be difficult," Jol said."It's not easy to go away from home to play against these teams. But I think we've got the players and the quality to get the result."The Fulham boss does not believe that early-season form will be an indication of which club will be relegated from the Premier League.

October 21, 2013, 7:00pm"Even when you're in the bottom three at Christmas it doesn't mean you will go down," he said, ahead of the clash at Selhurst Park."I remember Ian Holloway doing an unbelievable job at Blackpool. I think he was in the top eight at one stage four or five years ago and they still got relegated after Christmas."He played a different system, a very progressive 4-3-3 and he did it again with Crystal Palace. So I still feel that the man is doing a good job, but the results are not going for them."And hopefully Monday will be the same."Jol also denied speculation that morale is dipping in the Fulham dressing room following their poor start to the season."We've got a great team spirit, we've got new players in, I've got all these players, 80 per cent of the players are my players and the other players arehere for at least two years, so there's no problem," he added."The only problem we have is we had an indifferent result against Cardiff, but Cardiff beat Manchester City as well. So they're all strong these teams."I spoke to my friends and to other managers, and they all know that it's not easy to get results in the Premier League."
