    Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says he would be happy to welcome Cesc Fabregas back to the club in the future.
    Midfielder Fabregas, 26, played 303 games for the Gunners before joining 
    
Barcelona in a £35m 

     deal in 2011.
    He told the 
    
Daily Mail  

     and 
    
the Guardian  

     that he wants to return to Arsenal as a coach after his playing career ends.
    "I am very happy that a player of his intelligence, technical ability and knowledge of the game would come back one day," said Wenger.
    Spain international Fabregas also believes that Arsenal have the "strength of character" to make a strong challenge for the Premier League title.
    "I hope he is right on the two sides," added Wenger. "That he'll come back shows he has kept fond memories of this club."
