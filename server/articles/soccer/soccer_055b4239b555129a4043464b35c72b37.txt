Monaco midfielder Jeremy Toulalan played down the significance of his side's first league defeat of the season at the weekend and insisted their principal target is Champions League qualification, not the domestic title.The Monegasques went down 2-0 at Lille on Sunday night to slip to third in the table, behind Rene Girard's men, and three points adrift of leaders Paris St Germain.The visitors had their chances but a goal in each half from Nolan Roux, and a fine display from Lille goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama, saw them suffer their first league defeat since May."It was not good in the first period," Toulalan told L'Equipe."It was much better after the break, we had a lot of chances but success eluded us."We never gave up and this defeat was not deserved. I think a draw would have been fair."Former Lyon and Malaga midfielder Toulalan vowed the players will knuckle down in training this week with a view to moving level on points with PSG by beating Evian on Friday."We cannot always be at the top," he added."With the accumulation of matches and fatigue, it happens."It is hard right now but you have to push this week to work and prepare for the match against Evian."Monaco spent big in the summer on the likes of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez, Joao Moutinho and Ricardo Carvalho but Toulalan believes a top-three finish is the height of their ambition."We will do what we can to hang on," he said, "but the priority is the Champions League. We will not panic."
