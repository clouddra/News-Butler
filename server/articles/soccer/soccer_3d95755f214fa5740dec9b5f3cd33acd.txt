Fraser Fyvie: Yeovil loanee set to miss outYeovil will be without new loan signing Fraser Fyvie for Saturday's Sky Bet Championship clash with Nottingham Forest at Huish Park.The Scottish midfielder, borrowed from Wigan, made his Glovers debut against Brighton but had to come off with a shoulder injury.Manager Gary Johnson expects him to be sidelined for two weeks which could open the door for Luke Ayling to return to the starting line-up.Johnson's side have not picked up three points since the opening day and it remains to be seen whether the former Bristol City manager will recall Paddy Madden and Sam Foley to his matchday squad after the pair were both left out against the Seagulls despite being available.Eric Lichaj and Nathaniel Chalobah, meanwhile, return from suspension for Nottingham Forest, but Henri Lansbury is banned.Right-back Lichaj and on-loan Chelsea midfielder Chalobah both missed the 1-1 home draw with Bournemouth last weekend - Lichaj for amassing five yellow cards and Chalobah after he was sent off in the victory at Brighton prior to the international break.Lansbury scored Forest's goal against the Cherries but later received his fifth caution of the campaign so he will sit it out at Huish Park.Centre-half Danny Collins looks set to miss out after sustaining ankle ligament damage against Bournemouth so fit-again Kelvin Wilson, who replaced him in that match, is likely to make his first start since mid-September.
