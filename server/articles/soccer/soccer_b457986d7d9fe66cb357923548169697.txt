Frank Lampard was delighted to help Chelsea mark their return to Premier League action with victory over Cardiff City.Fresh from helping England to book their place at the 2014 World Cup, Lampard was back on domestic duty on Saturday.His efforts in midfield helped those around him to flourish, with Samuel Eto'o, Oscar and a brace from Eden Hazard seeing Chelsea to a 4-1 win.Lampard admits switching focus from one form of competition to another is never easy, but is pleased to see Jose Mourinho's side keeping pace with the top-flight front-runners - with a comprehensive success on home soil lifting them into second place.He told Sky Sports: "It was a very tough game for us. Sometimes after internationals you can be a bit slow to start, but I thought Cardiff were very well organised. Having gone 1-0 down, it's a very good result for us."It is difficult, but we've got a big squad here. It's important that we try and stay fresh, the manager changes it sometimes."If you get a positive result internationally, which a lot of us did, you can bring that back with you."I think the main thing is focus and concentration. We want to stay at the top of the league, we don't want to lose ground."
