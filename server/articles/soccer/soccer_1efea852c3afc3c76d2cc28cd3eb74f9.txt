Robert Mak and Christian Guenter battle for possessionFreiburg picked up their first win of the season against fellow strugglers Nurnberg, who will be left wondering how they were beaten 3-0 at home despite playing so well at the Frankenstadion.Felix Klaus, Vladimir Darida and Admir Mehmedi all scored for Christian Streich's troops, who ended the game with just 10 men after Oliver Sorg saw red in the 69th minute.Nurnberg had chances to put the game beyond doubt before Freiburg struck in the 57th minute, turning the game on its head and going on to win and move above their opponents in the standings.Even after a full week to get to know his team, Gertjan Verbeek was clearly happy with the side he sent out for his first game as Nurnberg coach a week ago as he named the same players for this relegation battle.The approach was similar too with his players looking more confident than they had been under predecessor Michael Weisinger, even if they only lost three games out of nine before the change in coach.Makoto Hasebe went close to giving them the lead in the 19th minute, but Oliver Baumann, criticised for his three mistakes against Hamburg a week ago, turned his shot against the post - the eighth time Nurnberg have hit the woodwork this season.Baumann was clearly keen to put that performance against Hamburg behind him as he kept Freiburg in the game, turning Emanuel Pogatetz's header over the crossbar in the 26th minute.From the corner, Pogatetz had the ball in the back of the net but not, according to the referee, without having fouled his opponent, and the goal was ruled out.Marvin Plattenhardt missed Nurnberg's next great chance two minutes into the second half when he only had Baumann to beat before he failed to convert Per Nilsson's cross.Nurnberg were punished for their profligacy in the 57th minute when Pogatetz deflected a cross kindly for Klaus, who scored from close range.Sorg picked up his second yellow card moments later, giving Nurnberg hope that they would be able to turn things around, but they wasted even more chances before Darida showed why Freiburg had invested in him in the summer with his first Bundesliga goal, a stunner from almost 30 yards.Mehmedi finished Nurnberg off in the 88th minute when he capitalised on a short backpass from Nilsson to beat a helpless Raphael Schafer.
