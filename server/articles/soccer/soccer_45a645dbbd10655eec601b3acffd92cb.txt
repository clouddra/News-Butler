    Norwich manager Chris Hughton says Uefa needs to implement "harsher penalties" on racist abuse, as they 
    
investigate CSKA Moscow's fans' behaviour 

     during the Champions League game against Manchester City.
    City midfielder Yaya Toure said he was subjected to racist chanting during his team's 2-1 win in Moscow on Wednesday, but CSKA Moscow consider the racism allegations to be "unfounded".
    The police are currently investigating alleged racial abuse of Hughton on social media and he says "fines are easily paid, particularly by the bigger clubs".
