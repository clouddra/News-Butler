FC Twente are three points clear at the top of the Eredivisie table following a 1-0 win at Cambuur Leeuwarden on Friday night.Michel Jansen's side began the weekend top of the table and they are likely to finish it there after Luc Castaignos scored the game's only goal on 49 minutes.Free-scoring Twente failed to add another thereafter, but with a goal difference of plus 17 already, closest rivals PSV Eindhoven would need to beat RKC Waalwijk by five goals on Sunday to move past them.
