Matt Mills insists the Bolton squad has a togetherness after they looked to have finally kick-started their season.Following a run of results which almost saw them creep into the play-off places last term, the Trotters' start to this Sky Bet Championship campaign was underwhelming and not in keeping with their pre-season predictions as one of the favourites for promotion.Dougie Freedman's men did not record their first victory until October but they are currently on a six-match unbeaten run which suggests the corner has been turned.Mills was part of a defence which ended Bournemouth's run of scoring in every league game this season as Bolton made it back-to-back away wins with a 2-0 triumph on Saturday.Speaking to the club's official website, Mills, who admits the next challenge is to secure the first home victory, said: "We have won our last two away games and we have been well organised both times. As a defender it was great to have kept a clean sheet and that is what we pride ourselves on."The fans were excellent yet again, they packed the away end out and really got behind the team. When Jermaine Beckford scored our last goal, all the players went over as a team to show that we are all in it together."We need to take our away performances into games at the Reebok Stadium. We have an important game at home against Millwall on Saturday and we need to go on and win that."
