Michael Carrick says Manchester United's players must stand up and take responsibility for the club's worst start to a league campaign in 24 years.Saturday's 1-1 draw with Southampton at Old Trafford leaves United in mid-table limbo, with the same number of points as newly-promoted Hull City.The meagre haul of 11 from eight games represents the club's worst start to a league season for 24 years and Carrick admits the Premier League table does not make comfortable reading."It is not easy reading now," said Carrick."Looking at the table as it is now is not something we are used to."It is frustrating because things are not going the way we want."But as players we have to stand up, take responsibility and get better."We just have to keep believing."We are still confident. Everything is in place but for some reason, at the moment, we are not quite clicking and not quite firing."United defender Phil Jones also admitted that the dressing room was left frustrated following the surprise home draw with Southampton."Having won at Sunderland we wanted to really kick on," said Jones."Although we haven't lost we are still disappointed."It's so frustrating. We controlled the game but we could have done with that second goal and in the end we've conceded a sloppy goal at the other end."
