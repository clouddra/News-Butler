Wolves boss Kenny Jackett wants his promotion-chasing side become more clinical after conceding late in the 1-1 draw Coventry.Leigh Griffiths looked to have put Wanderers on course for a ninth win in 10 league games with his eighth goal of the season in the 67th minute, only for substitute Aaron Phillips to earn City a deserved 1-1 draw four minutes from time.Jackett said: "When we do have our periods like we did in the second half, when we are on top and you can see the goal coming, we need more than one. We need to be able to put sides away."We are disappointed to have conceded so late when we got our noses in front after building up a good head of steam following an even first half."We dominated from the start of the second half and you could see the goal coming."It is disappointing that we didn't close it out because for long periods we were the side in charge. We should have tested the 'keeper more and done more up and around their box. The ball was up and around there a lot of the time and we should have carved out more."In terms of ourselves going forward we feel that we can create more."We have been quite clinical this season and in the second half I could see us building up towards goals and a win. When it came we really should have sealed it and seen the game out."While we are not disappointed with our points total, going forward we are looking to be able to put sides away when we are on top because it is a crucial part of the game for any side."
