Sweden international Jiloan Hamad claims he attracted interest from Sunderland and West Ham United before agreeing to join Hoffenheim.Bundesliga club Hoffenheim confirmed earlier this week that winger Hamad will join the club from Malmo during the winter break.The 22-year-old had been linked with several clubs across Europe, but he is confident he has made the right decision to sign for Hoffenheim."Everything felt right immediately," Hamad told Fotbollskanalen.se regarding his deal with Hoffenheim."It was Hoffenheim who contacted us. They have scouted me thoroughly, and their coach and sporting director have got big confidence in me. That feels good."I have been negotiating with many clubs from Russia, Italy, France and England. West Ham and Sunderland were among them, but none of them felt as good as Hoffenheim when their sporting director came."It was not a difficult choice, and my agents Nenad and Ferhat have done a fantastic job."Hamad is confident he will be suited by Hoffenheim's style of play and he aims to be a first-team regular before the end of the season.He added: "I will get the chance when I am ready."The team plays in a 4-2-3-1 formation, it is an offensive set-up where they want to recover the ball quickly. That suits me well and the club also think that."The target is to be a regular starter by the summer, if not earlier."I want to move on in my career, play for a better team where I get to play tougher and tougher matches at a higher pace."
