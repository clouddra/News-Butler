    Manager Alan Pardew thinks 10-man Newcastle were a match for Liverpool in the 
    
2-2 draw at St James' Park 

     and says the result feels "like a win".
    Yohan Cabaye's superb 30-yard strike put the Magpies ahead, but Steven Gerrard equalised from the spot after Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa was sent off for a foul on Luis Suarez. Paul Dummett's first senior goal for the club restored the home side's lead only for Daniel Sturridge to nod the Reds level again. 
    Newcastle-born Dummett has been at the club since 2008 having come through the youth system, and Pardew says his goal was "the biggest moment" of the game as it meant so much to the local player.
