Ivaylo Petev has resigned as Levski Sofia head coach after having his shirt removed by angry fans during his first press conference.The 38-year-old was presented to the media at the Georgi Asparuhov stadium on Tuesday, but a group of supporters, accusing him of having an allegiance to arch rivals CSKA Sofia, removed some of his clothes.Petev, who denied the claims, said: "I thought over things a lot, listened to the opinions of my family, which is important."I'm not a criminal, I'm not a thief, but yesterday I felt exactly like that. What did I do to deserve this?"Levski chief executive Nasko Sirakov said of the attack: "This is not my Levski, and these are not our fans.  It's a shame and a disgrace to the name of The Apostle (Vasil Levski)."Vladimir Vladimirov, chairman of the team's national fan-club, retorted: "We'll not allow this Petev to be coach of Levski. We'll not retreat from our position. I'm not speaking on my behalf but on behalf of thousands of Levski supporters."As a result of Petev's departure, Levski assistant coach Antony Zdravkov will take charge of the club until the winter break.
