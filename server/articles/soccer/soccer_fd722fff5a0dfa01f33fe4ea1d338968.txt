Bury caretaker boss Ronnie Jepson accused Mansfield of time-wasting tactics following the goalless draw at Gigg Lane.A point saw the Stags move up to seventh place in League Two but they had to survive John Dempster's red card in the 64th minute.Jepson felt the visitors came for just a point and called the performance of Paul Cox's team "ridiculous".He said: "We had a great game of football on Saturday against Portsmouth and then Mansfield just wanted to look for set-pieces and slow the game down."It was like a testimonial at times because of the pace they were going at. It's ridiculous and everybody gets frustrated."Seven minutes were added on but you could've added another three minutes from within that seven minutes for the amount of time-wasting that went on. It was incredible."It's not a great spectacle. I don't mind if it's at the end of the game but it was throughout the game."We just couldn't get in our stride. The lads are frustrated but they just have to keep doing what they're trying to do."We had opportunities and got enough ball in the box. I'd just like to see something come off somebody's knee or an own goal."We just need anything. Everyone at the football club, from the chairman to the supporters, wants a result."
