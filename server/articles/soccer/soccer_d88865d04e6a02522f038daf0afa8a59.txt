FC Twente coach Michel Jansen has told his players that Cambuur deserve their respect as the league leaders prepare to face the promoted side away from home.Twente, who top the Eredivisie on goal difference from PSV Eindhoven and Heerenveen, have the first opportunity to add to their tally of 15 points when they play on Friday night.But Cambuur, unbeaten at home so far, could prove tricky opposition."We respect Cambuur," Jansen told the club's website. "If you look at their statistics, seven goals for and seven against, it suggests they have a well-organised team."Cambuur have some good players and they will be supported by an enthusiastic crowd."For us it is important to focus from the first minute."Should there be any slip by Twente, Heerenveen will get their chance to claim top spot when they travel to ADO Den Haag on Saturday evening, with PSV - who surrendered top spot after losing 2-1 to AZ Alkmaar last weekend - waiting until Sunday to host RKC Waalwijk.That win for AZ was not, however, enough to preserve the job of coach Gertjan Verbeek, who was sacked only a day later despite the club sitting just two points from the summit and having made a winning start in the Europa League.The club said the board's decision was based on growing rifts between the coach and his players, but there had been no sign of it affecting performances on the pitch.Assistant Martin Haar will be in charge for Sunday's trip to FC Groningen while the club seek a permanent successor.PSV were not the only notable scalp in Verbeek's collection this season prior to his departure, as his side had also knocked off defending champions Ajax.The Amsterdam giants lie fourth and one point off the pace after romping to a convincing 6-0 win over the Go Ahead Eagles last weekend, and will be hoping to keep that form going in Sunday morning's match against another side at the wrong end of the table, FC Utrecht.Go Ahead have a slightly easier assignment at home to rock-bottom NEC Nijmegen, who have taken only four points from their opening eight games, failing to win any of them.PEC Zwolle, just one point off the pace in fifth, will test their strong start to the campaign away to Roda JC, while NAC Breda host Heracles Almelo in Saturday's other game.Sunday's fixtures are completed by a lunchtime meeting between Vitesse Arnhem and Feyenoord.
