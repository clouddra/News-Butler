Walsall boss Dean Smith felt his side deserved to beat 10-man Stevenage by a bigger margin following their 2-1 win.Romaine Sawyers and Craig Westcarr put the hosts in control at the Banks's Stadium, with Francois Zoko's effort mere consolation before Lucas Akins was sent off in the 80th minute as the Saddlers ran out 2-1 winners.Smith said: "We allowed them back into the game with a goal that should never have been, but I was really pleased with the performance."I thought we were very good and some of our passing was excellent, we deserved to be more than one up at half-time"We knew there would be a competitive side to the game and you have to compete against teams like Stevenage, we did that well."We were really entertaining and I thought we were on top for the majority of the game."
