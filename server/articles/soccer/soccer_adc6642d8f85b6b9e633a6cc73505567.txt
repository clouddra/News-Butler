Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson believes they can keep pace with the leading sides in the Premier League this season if they maintain their consistency.The Reds have made a positive start to the campaign and currently sit in third spot, two points behind league leaders Arsenal.Liverpool have been tipped as potential title contenders and Henderson can see no reason why they cannot remain in the upper echelons of the table in what he sees as a "wide open" championship race."Hopefully we will carry this good start to the season onwards," Henderson told the Daily Mirror. "There is a long way to go so we will definitely just be keeping our feet on the ground and keep working hard in training."Come the end of the season, if we can keep our consistency going and playing the way we have, we will be OK. At the moment it looks pretty wide open at the top, but you never know how it's going to turn out."Things can change at any time so we have just got to concentrate on ourselves and make sure we put in good performances every week."
