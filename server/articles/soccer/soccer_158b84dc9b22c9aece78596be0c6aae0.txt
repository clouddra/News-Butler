CSKA Moscow maintain that the racist abuse suffered by Manchester City's Yaya Toure in Russia was exaggerated.Ahead of a return date between the two clubs in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday, CSKA coach Leonid Slutsky has been quizzed on the events which unfolded at the Arena Khimki on 23rd October.His side have been sanctioned by UEFA for the behaviour of their fans during that contest, with the club set to play their next European home game at a partially closed stadium.Repeatedly pressed on the matter at Monday's pre-match press conference, Slutsky said: "We have already spoken about our official position. It is normal, like many people, we are against racism.




"What I can say is the club is categorically against racism. We think the situation has been exaggerated and there was an over-reaction."

We love them and give them our support."As for the match, we did not hear any racial slurs, so it is difficult to comment."What I can say is the club is categorically against racism. We think the situation has been exaggerated and there was an over-reaction."We have received our punishment, and it was up to UEFA to make this decision."A club official tried on a number of occasions to steer questions away from the racism issue at an increasingly fractious media conference but they continued to recur.Slutsky was asked if the club would make a personal apology to Toure but would not comment.He said: "I think we have discussed this matter enough already."Another question was pushed away with a response of: "The sooner we finish this matter the better. It has been discussed over and over again and brings unhealthy speculation."When asked if the club were concerned about a repeat offence from supporters at the Etihad Stadium, media director Sergei Aksenov interrupted to say: "Let us wait for them to repeat it and then feel sorry for that."Man City v CSKA Moscow is on Sky Sports 2 on Tuesday night from 7pm
