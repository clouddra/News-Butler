Newport boss Justin Edinburgh was thrilled with his side after they came from 2-0 down to knock Crawley out of the JPT with a 3-2 win.The Football League newcomers, who beat Championship club Brighton in the Capital One Cup on their last visit to Sussex, trailed 2-0 midway through the first half before goals from Chris Zebroski, Adam Chapman and an own goal turned the tie on its head.Edinburgh said: "It was an entertaining game and you've got to give my players credit in the second half."It was disappointing from our perspective that we conceded two goals but we scored our first at a really good time to give us some belief going into the second half."We had much more tempo and more physicality second half, it didn't seem as if it meant enough too much to us first half but it certainly did in the second."They threw men forward late on in the game but we dealt with it really well."
