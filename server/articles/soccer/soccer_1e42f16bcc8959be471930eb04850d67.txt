    Manager Chris Hughton takes "full responsibility" for Norwich's 
    
7-0 defeat at Manchester City, 

     their heaviest in the Premier League.
    City "dominated from start to finish" as Bradley Johnson's own goal put the hosts ahead before first-half strikes from David Silva, Matija Nastasic and Alvaro Negredo.
    Further goals from Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and substitute Edin Dezko completed the scoring as the Canaries "let down" their travelling support.
