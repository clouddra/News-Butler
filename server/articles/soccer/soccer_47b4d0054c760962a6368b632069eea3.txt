    Football Association chairman Greg Dyke responded to criticism of his commission to improve the England team by stressing he is still keen to recruit black and ethnic members.
    Heather Rabbatts, the FA's only female board member, 
    
criticised the group's all-white, all-male make-up.
    Dyke admitted making a "mistake" in announcing only part of the line-up.
    But he added: "To suggest we never considered the ethnic balance of the commission is unfair."
    Jamaica-born Rabbatts, 57, wrote a letter to Dyke and fellow board members to complain about "a lack of diversity", saying she had no choice but to go public as there had been a "refusal to understand" her position in private.
    Rabbatts said: "The opportunity to lead an informed debate on the future of English players has been singularly damaged."
