Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale is back in full training and is in line to return against Malaga at the weekend.Bale has made just one start for the Spanish club since he arrived for a world record fee in the summer due to a thigh injury.However, the former Tottenham star came through a full session overseen by Real manager Carlo Ancelotti on Wednesday and is now in line to return in Saturday's clash with Malaga."Ancelotti had the majority of the internationals at his disposal as well as Bale to prepare for the Malaga game," said a statement issued by the Spanish club.Bale's pre-season was disrupted by the drawn-out negotiations over his move and there has been a question mark over his fitness since the deal was concluded.Real acted quickly to deny a report in Marca sports daily at the weekend that said Bale was suffering from a slipped disc and club president Florentino Perez denounced the newspaper in a television interview."The player Gareth Bale has a small chronic disc bulge, which is extremely common among football players and by no means prevents him from carrying out his professional activity normally," the club said.Real host Italian side Juventus in the Champions League next Wednesday before playing at arch rivals and La Liga leaders Barcelona in Spain's 'Clasico' on October 26.
