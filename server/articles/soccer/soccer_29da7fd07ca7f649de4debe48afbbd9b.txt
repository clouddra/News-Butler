Jumping for joy: Fabrizio Cacciatore celebrates his opener for VeronaJorginho scored two second-half penalties as Hellas Verona came from behind to beat Parma 3-2 on Sunday afternoon.Fabrizio Cacciatore put the hosts ahead in the ninth minute before goals from Marco Parolo and Antonio Cassano gave Parma a 2-1 lead after 25 minutes.Jorginho equalised on the hour mark and the Brazilian then earned and converted his second spot-kick two minutes from time to hand Verona their fifth win of the campaign.Parma went into the encounter at the Marc'Antonio Bentegodi stadium looking for their first win on the road this season.And it was the hosts who took an early lead when Parma failed to clear a dangerous ball into the area and Cacciatore took advantage to strike a right-footed shot from 12 yards past Parma goalkeeper Pavol Bajza.The visitors equalised 10 minutes later when Parolo's fierce strike from 30 yards beat Verona keeper Rafael.Parolo then turned provider as he fed Cassano in the area and the former AC Milan star chested the ball down before hitting a right-footed volley past Rafael to put the visitors in front.Parma were unlucky not to make it 3-1 on the half-hour mark when Alessandro Lucarelli's powerful header struck the crossbar.Luca Toni had the first opportunity of the second half with a right-footed shot from the edge of the area that went wide.The referee then awarded Verona their first penalty when Toni was brought down inside the area by Mattia Cassani.Jorginho struck the spot-kick into the bottom right corner out of Bajza's reach.At the other end Rafael did well to keep out Parolo's 10-yard attempt.But with four minutes remaining, the referee pointed again to the spot after Jorginho was pulled down in the area by Marco Marchionni.The Brazilian fired his spot-kick the same way as his first penalty and beat Bajza to hand Verona all three points.
