Werder Bremen coach Robin Dutt spoke of his relief after returning to winning ways at the Weser Stadion with a 3-2 win over Hannover on Sunday.It was the northern Germany club's first win in four in front of their own fans and one which pleased Dutt, as it did the sell-out crowd."Of course when you are under pressure to show your fans what you can do, and you keep getting draws, then it's a huge weight off your shoulders to win," Dutt said."You can see that because it's so much fun to work with this team when you then win."They work so much during the week, really pulling along, and we've got an excellent team spirit."The morale at opponents Hannover is suffering, conversely, from a slump in form which, according to their coach Mirko Slomka, is compromising their hopes of qualifying for Europe this season.After losing their excellent home record last weekend, they lost for the fifth time in five away games to slip four points behind the top six."We've got to take our chances better," said Slomka to Sky television."It's bitter to get punished so late on and this is a very frustrating defeat because we've totally taken a step away from our aims."
