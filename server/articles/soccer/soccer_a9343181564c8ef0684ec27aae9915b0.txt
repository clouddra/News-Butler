Rui Miguel: Saved Pacos Ferreira's blushes against Pandurii Targu-JiuRui Miguel's strike early in the second half saved Pacos Ferreira's blushes in a 1-1 draw against Pandurii Targu-Jiu in Europa League Group E.Last season's runners-up in the Romanian Liga I took a fifth-minute lead through Marko Momcilovic's close-range finish.But Miguel spared the Portuguese side's blushes four minutes after half-time to ensure Pacos and Pandurii each got their first point in Group E after being defeated by Fiorentina and Dnipro respectively in their opening matches.The visitors came flying out of the traps with Alexandru Ciucur's effort from just outside the area blocked by Filipe Anunciacao and from the resulting corner, they took a fifth-minute lead.Nicandro Breeveld's inswinging set-piece from the right allowed Momcilovic to fire into the top corner from close range.It was Pandurii's first goal in the group although they were nearly back on level terms almost immediately, with Rui Caetano guilty of missing the target from Manuel Jose's free-kick into the area.Defender Gregory Arnolin then saw a header well saved by Pandurii goalkeeper Joao Mingote, while Deividas Matulevicius had to make a vital block from on-loan Manchester United striker Bebe's effort from close range.At the other end, Arnolin made a vital interception to keep out a header from Eric Pereira, whose header just after half-time was well saved by Antonio Filipe.It proved a crucial save as Miguel levelled in the 49th minute after slotting home from close range following Jean Seri's lay-off.Bebe wasted an opportunity to put the hosts ahead after shooting straight at Joao Mingote a few minutes later although Pandurii were still proving an attacking threat with Tiago Valente making key blocks from Ciucur and goalscorer Momcilovic.Jose fired wide from inside the area and Paolo Hurtado fired over from 20 yards but it was Pandurii who finished strongly although they could not fashion any chances to reflect their superiority and both sides settled for a point.
