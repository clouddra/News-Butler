Juninho Quixada: Celebrates for the hosts against Dinamo ZagrebBulgarian champions Ludogorets continued their impressive start to the Europa League group stage with a comprehensive 3-0 win at home to Dinamo Zagreb.Ludogorets caused a shock by winning away at PSV Eindhoven in their Group B opener and looked equally assured on Thursday night as goals from Juninho Quixada, Virgil Misidjan and Svetoslav Dyakov saw them to all three points.Dinamo were hugely disappointing throughout and never looked in any danger of taking the fight to their hosts as they slumped to another defeat in the wake of their home reverse to Chornomorets last time out.Eleven minutes were on the clock when the hosts went in front, Fabio Espinho with a low ball from the right that Quixada turned in from close range.Ivo Pinto fired an effort straight at Ludogorets goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov on a rare Dinamo attack, but with 34 minutes gone the hosts were celebrating again when Misidjan fired into the roof of the net.Moments later Dinamo coach Branko Ivankovic made a change in midfield in a bid to stem the tide, with Bakary Sare replaced by Duje Cop, and for a while the move appeared to work with the hosts finishing the half on the front foot.First El Arbi Soudani's strike from 18 yards forced Stoyanov to punch clear, while moments before the half-time whistle Josip Simunic's header from Pinto's corner forced the Ludogorets number one into action again.Dinamo failed to kick on in the second half and the match was all but over in the 61st minute when Dyakov tucked a fine shot away from the edge of the box, while the same player went close to making it four with 20 minutes left but his shot sailed over.
