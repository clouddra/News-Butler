Former Rangers director Dave King believes he can play a leading role in restoring stability to the troubled club.Despite pleading guilty to 41 counts of breaching tax regulations in South Africa, King - who lost Â£20m when oldco Rangers entered administration in February 2012 - is confident there will be no issues over his return.King is keen to meet the only two members currently sitting on the Rangers board - Brian Stockbridge and James Easdale - in a bid to end the turmoil which continues to surround the club.Speaking to Sky Sports News, the Glasgow-born businessman, who is believed to be willing to reinvest in the Scottish League One side, said: "The purpose of the meeting really is two-fold."On one hand it is to see if I am in a position to facilitate taking the club forward, to get rid of the disharmony and the lack of unity both at board level and between the board and the fans."And secondly to see if I can assist in a fund-raising exercise where I would lead a funding campaign."That would make sure that when the club does need money it is already in place with the right people at the right cost."After an afternoon meeting with King, Sandy Easdale, a director on the club's football board and brother and business partner of James, said: "Dave's a very interesting man and I enjoyed his company."However our discussion was private and I will be saying nothing further."
