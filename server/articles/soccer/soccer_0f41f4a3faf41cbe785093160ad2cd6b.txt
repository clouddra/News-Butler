    Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas says his team deserved all three points in their 
    
2-0 away win against Aston Villa.
    Spurs convincingly bounced back from their shock home loss to West Ham United, with goals from Andros Townsend and Roberto Soldado. 
    The victory takes Tottenham up to fifth place in the Premier League.
