Torquay boss Alan Knill was delighted that his side ended their three-match losing streak with a 0-0 draw with Mansfield.Wales Under 21 winger Billy Bodin - instantly recalled after international duty - came closest to breaking the deadlock for the Gulls with a shot from 20 yards that came back off the foot of the post.United were reduced to 10 men in the 69th minute when central defender Krystian Pearce received a second caution for hauling down Mansfield attacker Sam Clucas.Nevertheless Mansfield found home keeper Martin Rice, who had earlier denied centre forward Matt Rhead, in fine form. Rice made a superb full-length stop to keep out substitute Ben Hutchinson's 30-yard try as the visitors pressed for a winner.Knill said: "We had conceded eight in three games and so to get that clean sheet is fantastic. It feels like a win. It was definitely a point gained and I think it might have been three if we kept 11 on the field."It was an outstanding effort especially after the last home game. We needed to put in a performance and we did that. There were a lot of positives to take from the game, it feels like a win."It's a clean sheet and that was important. We know we have got goals in us, we got two last week, but we needed to keep it tight at the back and we've done that."Billy's hit the post and that could have gone either way but it's just not dropping in for us at the moment. You get that at times and we are just not getting those little breaks you need."I am sure that once we get everyone, our key players, back - and hopefully Ben Harding will be back next week - then we will be all right. I am really sure we can compete in this league."
