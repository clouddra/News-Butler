Former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson said the Three Lions will fail to win the World Cup in Brazil next year.GettyImagesSven-Goran Eriksson predicts England won't win the World Cup in Brazil.• Smith: Hodgson's reality checkBut the Swede believes Russia could offer England the opportunity for glory in 2018.Roy Hodgson’s men sealed their spot for next year’s competition by winning, despite some difficulties, their European qualification group.But the former winners missed out on top seeding for next year’s finals and Eriksson said a run to the quarterfinals would be a good return for the ‘young’ side.   "I don't believe they can win the World Cup in Brazil,” Eriksson told BBC Radio 5. "There are a lot of young players coming in. Maybe in Russia."I think it's easier to win it there than in Brazil. For a European team to win in South America is not easy."Expectation does not seem to be what it was in the past and I think that's very good for the team."The quarterfinals would be very good. It is time for a semi-final or final."During his five-year tenure with England -- in which he led England to the last eight at three consecutive major finals -- Eriksson was a strong advocate of the Premier League introducing a winter break in order to benefit the national team  at tournament, a view which he still holds now."It's not that difficult," he said in an interview to promote his autobiography. "Take one week in January and give the players a week off, then take them in and prepare for the game after."I think everyone agrees if you take a break it will be very good for England."Is that the main thing holding England back? For sure, it's one thing, maybe the easiest thing. I know players would love it and they would feel better for the rest of the season."
