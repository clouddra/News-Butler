Hellas Verona midfielder Jorginho has told reporters in Italy that both Arsenal and Chelsea target have sent scouts to watch him.The Brazilian-born Italian has been touted as a major target for both London clubs during the transfer window after catching the eye with impressive performances for Verona.The midfielder has scored five goals in eight appearances so far this season, including two penalties against Parma at the weekend.The 21-year-old told the Gazetta Dello Sport: "In the match against Parma there were scouts from teams like Arsenal and Chelsea."Maybe if I keep playing well I can show exactly what I'm worth."His comments will alert both clubs to an apparent interest in a move, and reports have also emerged that Liverpool could enter the race for his signature, which is expected to cost over Â£10m.But his latest performance did not impress Verona manager Andrea Mandorlini, who branded his performance as his worst of the season.He said: "I changed his position more than once because he was struggling. In the end I decided to not replace him and perhaps that was the right decision."
