A look ahead to the weekend's action in Holland's Eredivisie, including AZ Alkmaar's trip to PEC Zwolle.AZ Alkmaar captain Maarten Martens believes his side are already prospering following the arrival of Dick Advocaat as coach.Advocaat was announced on a deal until the end of the season last week following the surprising departure of Gertjan Verbeek.A breakdown in relations with the players was cited as a reason for Verbeek's exit and Martens has reported a new wave of optimism around the AFAS Stadion following Advocaat's arrival."Dick is a great personality who dares to make decisions," Martens told Voetbal International."There were players who didn't see perspective before and now they feel there are new opportunities."Some players may think, 'What is happening here now? For others it is very refreshing."Advocaat led his new side to a 3-1 win over Cambuur Leeuwarden in his first game in charge last weekend, which has left them in eighth place, but just three points behind leaders FC Twente in a congested table.With a trip to surprise packages PEC Zwolle on Sunday to come, Martens thinks his side now have the belief to make inroads at the top."I realise that there was still some carelessness in the win over Cambuur," he said."But you can play it safe and there may be no goals. I am someone who always wants to take risks."Twente will, however, be expected to remain ahead of the chasing pack when they travel to struggling ADO Den Haag on Saturday.Michel Jansen's side, unbeaten in six, edged a point clear last weekend after PSV Eindhoven suffered a surprise 1-0 loss at FC Groningen.PSV will aim to bounce back at Roda JC, who ended a run of three league draws with a 2-1 win at RKC Waalwijk last weekend.Most of the top sides will be looking to bounce back from poor results last weekend.Champions Ajax followed a 1-1 draw at Twente with a 2-1 defeat to Celtic in the Champions League in midweek.
