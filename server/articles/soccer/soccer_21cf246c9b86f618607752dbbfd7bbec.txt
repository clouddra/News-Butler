Stefan Aigner and Marco Russ of FrankfurtManagerless Nurnberg picked up a point from their trip to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday afternoon, although a 1-1 draw still leaves them inside the bottom three.Vaclav Kadlec's fourth goal of the season was not enough to earn Frankfurt all three points with Josip Drmic levelling late on for Nurnberg, who are expected to appoint their new coach in the coming days.The Bavarians even had the chance to win it late on, but will be happy all the same with a sixth draw of the season which still gives their new coach a sizeable challenge to take on.The task seemed like it would be even greater as Frankfurt made a strong start, Stefan Aigner testing Raphael Schafer with a header in the fifth minute before falling under the challenge of Javier Pinola inside the area, but not earning a penalty.Schafer then saved from Tranquillo Barnetta's free-kick before Kadlec showed his team mates how to beat the Nurnberg keeper with a cool finish after the Bavarians' defence was caught napping.The goal sparked Nurnberg into life, Niklas Stark rattling the crossbar with a 30-yard effort which had Kevin Trapp beaten.They continued to push for an equaliser and found it in the 86th minute. Drmic was sent through by Robert Mak and he took the ball past Trapp and managed to thread it into the unguarded goal from a tight angle.The equaliser was deserved and Nurnberg nearly snatched all three points at the death when Pinola's shot was saved by the Frankfurt goalkeeper.
