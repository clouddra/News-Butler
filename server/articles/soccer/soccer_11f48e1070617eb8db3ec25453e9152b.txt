Ritchie De Laet: Only injury casualty for LeicesterLeicester have no new problems to contend with ahead of Saturday's Sky Bet Championship clash with Bournemouth at the King Power Stadium.Only full-back Ritchie De Laet will be absent after undergoing surgery last week on an infected cut on his shin. The Belgian is expected to be out for between four and six weeks.Foxes academy graduate Liam Moore is expected to switch to right-back again as cover for De Laet, leaving Poland international Marcin Wasilewski to partner captain Wes Morgan in the centre of defence.Strikers Chris Wood and Gary Taylor-Fletcher have recovered from their hamstring injuries and will hope to force their way into Nigel Pearson's plans having been unused substitutes for the 2-1 victory over Huddersfield last weekend.Bournemouth, meanwhile, are set to hand goalkeeper Ryan Allsop a start.His recall comes after West Ham loanee Stephen Henderson was forced off just 13 minutes into the 1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest after dislocating his shoulder.That injury is set to sideline him for six months and the shot-stopper has returned to Upton Park for treatment, meaning Allsop is on course to return to the starting line-up in his absence.Striker Brett Pitman staked his claim for a start with two goals in a midweek friendly with Reading while the likes of Eunan O'Kane, Shaun MacDonald, Wes Thomas and Miles Addison also got valuable game time and staked their claims to start.
