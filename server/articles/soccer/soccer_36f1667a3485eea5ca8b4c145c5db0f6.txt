Fernando Torres is a doubt for Chelsea's Champions League game at home to Schalke on Wednesday, according to the reports.

Torres, 29, is said to be struggling with a thigh problem that he aggravated during Monday's training.

The Spain international was substituted in the 62nd minute of Chelsea's 2-0 loss to Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday.

Torres has  five goals in all competitions to his name so far this season, but it remains to be seen if he will have a chance to add to that tally versus Schalke.

Should the striker be unavailable then Samuel Eto'o or Demba Ba will likely be chosen to lead the Blues' line.

Chelsea currently top Group E, after beating Schalke 3-0 in Germany in their last game, but manager Jose Mourinho is taking nothing for granted as they look to book their place in the knockout phase.

Mourinho told the club's official website: "We are in a stable position to qualify in the Champions League but if we lose again we are in a difficult position, so Wednesday is an important game for us."
