Shrewsbury boss Graham Turner admitted his side can take plenty of positives from pushing Peterborough in their 1-0 loss.Substitute Nathaniel Mendez-Laing scored the only goal of the game after 64 minutes, collecting a pass from skipper Tommy Rowe and cutting inside from the left flank before steering a 20-yard shot past Shrews goalkeeper Chris Weale.Turner said: "It goes down as a frustrating result and I can only sympathise with my players."They put in a tremendous amount of work and got no reward for it."It has taken a top quality goal to win the game and sometimes you have to hold your hands up and give credit to their player after a strike like that."We can go away safe in the knowledge that we put on a good show against one of the best sides in the division and we have to take heart from that."The slight negative is that we were very tentative in and around the Peterborough penalty area."Far too many shots went wide or the final ball was not good enough when we were in threatening positions."
