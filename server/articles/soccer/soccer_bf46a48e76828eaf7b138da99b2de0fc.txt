    Swansea City's Jonjo Shelvey could face disciplinary action after appearing to incite Cardiff City fans.
    Television footage apparently showed him gesturing to Cardiff fans following Sunday's south Wales derby.
    After 
    
Swansea lost 1-0 

     Shelvey appears to make a gesture known as 'swim away' and the Football Association confirmed it is investigating.
    'Swim away' refers to an alleged 1988 incident in which Cardiff fans went into the sea as supporters clashed.
    There had been concerns over potential trouble betweens fans at Sunday's game but South Wales Police tweeted on Sunday evening that no arrests had been made at City Stadium.

The tweet read:Â  

     "No arrests at the Cardiff City Stadium today. Great to see both sets of fans being passionate & well-behaved".
    During the game there were few controversial incidents until Swansea City goalkeeper Michel Vorm brought down Cardiff substitute Fraizer Campbell, earning him a red card and a 
    
one-game ban.
    Manager Michael Laudrup had already used all three substitutes so defender Angel Rangel ended up taking the gloves for the last few moments.
