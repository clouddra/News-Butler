Danish international Martin Braithwaite could be heading to Britain after a host of clubs checked on the Esbjerg player.The 22-year-old, who can play as a striker or on the wing, is of Guyana descent - hence his somewhat un-Scandinavian name - but he is starting to make a real name for himself in his homeland.Braithwaite has come through the youth ranks at Esbjerg, his hometown club, and has played for Denmark at every level form Under-17 up to the senior side, who he made his debut for earlier this year.Braithwaite's performances have not gone unnoticed, and it is reported that Scottish champions Celtic are monitoring his progress along with Premier League Hull City and Ipswich Town.A source close to the player confirmed to Sky Sports: "Martin has been progressing very well over the past 12-months and he is now a full international."He knows of the interest in England and Scotland, and he is excited by that - but he is trying to stay focused and not get distracted."
