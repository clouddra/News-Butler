    Manager Chris Hughton admits that the "quality" of Arsenal's play proved the difference as his Norwich side 
    
lose 4-1 at the Emirates.
    Mesut Ozil scored twice and substitute Aaron Ramsey added to Jack Wilshere's opening goal, with Jonny Howson for the Canaries.
    The defeat leaves Norwich in the 
    
bottom three 

     with seven points from eight games, but Hughton cautions that it's "very early" in the season.
