Paris Saint Gremain youngster Adrien Rabiot insists he won't remain at the club just so they have a Parisian native in the squad.Highly-rated Rabiot has come through the youth ranks at PSG, having also spent time with Manchester City.The 18-year-old midfielder spent part of last season on loan at Toulouse before returning to the capital, but this term he has started just two league games.And Rabiot admits he will not allow himself to get into a situation like that of Mamadou Sakho, who many felt stayed at PSG for too long due to a sense of loyalty before his move to Liverpool this season.Rabiot, who has been strongly linked with a move to England over the past 12 months, told Le Parisien: "I know it is important to the leaders and supporters. But that's not enough."If it is to be set aside on the day where others players are recruited in my position, it is not worth it."I do not want to live the way Mamadou Sakho did."After a while, when he realised he would not play much, he took the decision to leave and he did well."If a new midfielder is recruited in the winter transfer window, it will change the game for me. I would then think about my future."
