New Inter Milan owner Erick Thohir wants more players from the club's youth teams to have an impact in the senior side.Thohir, whose company International Sports Capital owns 70 per cent of the Nerazzurri outfit, has inherited a squad that is loaded with stars the Italian giants have bought.Just one player, Marco Andreolli, from Inter's 28-man squad has come through the club's youth ranks."My dream is to use more players from the youth teams that do well in their respective competitions," Thohir said in an interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica."I believe that a lot of talented Italian youngsters have the right to be given a chance to play in the first team and prove just how much they are worth."We have to be confident."The team that I want is a mix of experience and fresh athletic ability."I can assure the Nerazzurri fans that I am coming to Milan to win."Thohir rested no importance to his team's 3-3 draw at Torino on Sunday.The result left Walter Mazzarri's side in fifth place, nine points adrift of Serie A leaders Roma."Sometimes you draw and it can happen that you lose a few games," Thohir said. "But what is clear is that this year's Inter is beautiful to watch."
