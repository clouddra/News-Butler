Michael Laudrup does not feel new Sunderland boss Gus Poyet needs to panic despite their plight at the bottom of the Premier League.Laudrup's Swansea handed Sunderland a 4-0 hiding in Poyet's first game in charge, breaking the shackles in the second half after 45 minutes of frustration in front of goal.Sunderland's meagre tally of one point in eight games equals the worst start to a Premier League season but Laudrup feels a confidence-boosting win or two is all the Black Cats need to start their climb up the table."There are still 30 games to go, if you suddenly get two wins and six points you are right there," Laudrup said."I know in this moment right now it seems very difficult for them, but sometimes you just need a little bit of luck in one game and you can win it 1-0 and you are back again."You see it with a lot of teams in different competitions. You can never say they are out of it."I always say that things are decided during the last two months of the season."I have never seen a team win the title or get relegated in October, November or December."
