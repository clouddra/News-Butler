A look ahead to the weekend's action in France's Ligue 1, including Marseille's clash with Reims.Marseille coach Elie Baup has urged supporters not to dwell on their Champions League woes and focus on helping the club rise up the Ligue 1 table, starting on Saturday against Reims.OM slumped to their fourth successive defeat in all competitions in midweek after going down 2-1 at home to Napoli.That result has all but ended their hopes of advancing from Group F, which also includes Borussia Dortmund and Arsenal, but Baup is hoping the fans can make allowances given the quality of opposition they are facing in Europe.He said in L'Equipe: "We especially want to succeed in this game (against Reims) and show our true face."I hope the fans can make a distinction between what we do in the Champions League and results in the league."I do not mind that we are criticised for not having won in Bastia and Nice, but not in the Champions League."Marseille go into the weekend in fifth place, seven points behind leaders and arch rivals Paris St Germain.PSG were also in action in midweek with star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic again stealing the show in a 5-0 thrashing of Anderlecht.The Sweden international scored four times at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium to put the Parisians on the brink of qualification.PSG return to action on Sunday at St Etienne and may take to the field having relinquished top spot to Monaco, who take on Lyon earlier in the day.Facing Laurent Blanc's side is currently a daunting prospect and St Etienne defender Loic Perrin has warned the visitors' threat will not just come from Ibrahimovic and strike partner Edinson Cavani.He told Radio Monte Carlo: "We fear everyone, Ibra, Cavani and all the others."They have shown that the danger can come from anywhere. This is what makes the strength of this team."Sunday's other game sees Bordeaux host Montpellier.Third-placed Lille could move within a point of PSG when they visit Nantes in fourth on Friday night while there is plenty of focus on the battle at the bottom on Saturday.Valenciennes, who currently prop up the rest, will fancy their chances of recording a second Ligue 1 win of the season when they host Evian.And Sochaux, under new boss Herve Renard, go to Lorient in a battle between teams currently occupying places in the relegation zone.Guingamp meet Ajaccio while Nice visit Bastia.
