New chief executive Guy Wolfenden will be working hard to boost Exeter's gates once he takes charge on a full-time basis next week.The 40-year-old was appointed because of his experience in sports management, most notably with Somerset Cricket Club where he used a variety of techniques to get more supporters in their wide catchment area through the turnstiles.And Wolfenden, who has been a familiar face around the ground before taking the reins, is relishing the challenge of doing the same at St James Park where the average attendance has been 4400 in League Two this season."I am really looking forward to making sure we fill this ground as often as we can," he said."That helps the players, the management and that drives everything for me. It always adds an extra element when you have a full stadium."There is no magic wand that is going to deliver 8,500 people here week in week out. There is a lot of work to do and a lot of hard work."There is a willingness to get stuck in and do the dirty work and make sure everyone who can know about them, (the club's matches) do."At Somerset we were lucky to do that and put the processes in place to do that so I am very much keen to do that and build on it."
