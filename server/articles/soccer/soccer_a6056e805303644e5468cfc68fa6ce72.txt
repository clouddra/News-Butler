Michael Gardyne insists he is loving life at Kilmarnock despite their poor start to the season.The Dundee United striker joined Killie on a six-month loan deal in the summer in a bid to boost his chances of playing regular football when he returns to Tannadice.He already has several appearances under his belt and is pleased with the move so far, albeit his temporary club have yet to get off the mark with a win this season.Gardyne said: "It's going well. I've started almost every game since I've been here."I've done okay and the boys have welcomed me. Everything is going well and I'm enjoying it."With St Mirren claiming their first win of the season against Hearts before the international break, Kilmarnock are now the only Scottish Premiership side without a victory so far this term.Gardyne is well aware of how important back-to-back home games against Ross County - another of his former clubs - and bottom side Hearts could be in shaping Killie's season.He said: "St Mirren did well to get their first win so it's just us now. These next two games are massive so hopefully on Saturday we can get that first win."We have worked hard over the break and we are looking forward to getting back into it."Ross County and Hearts, both at home, are two massive games."But we need to concentrate on the Ross County game first and they will be a threat but we just have to worry about ourselves."
