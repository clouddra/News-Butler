Boss Steve Clarke says West Brom must go to Liverpool with confidence or else risk becoming the latest victims of the 'SAS'.Liverpool strikers Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez are fast becoming one of the most potent partnerships in the Premier League and have been dubbed the new 'SAS', with Blackburn's Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton the first to be given the nickname back in the 1990s.The Baggies are unbeaten in five games, and Clarke - who was once assistant boss at Liverpool when Kenny Dalglish was manager - says that they cannot afford to go there frightened of the hosts' in-form strikers."We will go to Anfield with confidence, being five games unbeaten," the Scot said."We're never daunted by going to the big grounds and we go to these places with the intention of winning the game. That's the frame of mind you have to approach these games in."You have to know that you're good enough to go to somewhere like Anfield and compete. If you go with an inferiority complex, you're beaten before you even get there."It will be a difficult game. Liverpool are a different team to last season and have started this season well."Our games against them last season are good memories but are no reference to what will happen this season."Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez deserve all the praise they get. Having said that, I don't think Jonas Olsson and Gareth McAuley will be losing any sleep on Friday night worrying about facing them."Our players will be looking forward to the challenge of keeping those players quiet."McAuley said: "Suarez is a quality player, world class. He knows where the back of the net is and he's a handful. He's someone we'll need to keep a close eye on."Suarez and Sturridge are clever players. They link well and one of them can go long while the other comes short."They have good movement and it's going to be up to us to make clever decisions in the game. We'll have to be on top of our game if we're going to stop them."
