    Steven Thompson's late winner ensured this all-Saints clash ended with the Buddies' first home win of the season.
    Kenny McLean's opened the scoring for St Mirren, but it was quickly cancelled out by Steven MacLean.
    Paul McGowan and McLean twice put the Buddies ahead, with the visitors' Frazer Wright dismissed.
    Nigel Hasselbaink and Rory Fallon took turns to reply, but Thompson had the final say and St Mirren go three games unbeaten.

    Had St Mirren captain Jim Goodwin not had a second-half penalty saved it could have been more comfortable.
    For Tommy Wright's Perth charges, it is their first defeat in four matches and they lie seventh in the league as their early season inconsistency continues.
    There was only the letter A of a difference between the first two goalscorers in Paisley and there was not much to separate their teams either.
    Both sides looked to play neat and tidy football where possible and most of the goals were end products of intelligent play.
    St Mirren's McGowan, playing in between middle and front, produced an intricate, short pass to find McLean, who duly finished in a composed manner into the bottom right corner past St Johnstone goalkeeper Alan Mannus.
