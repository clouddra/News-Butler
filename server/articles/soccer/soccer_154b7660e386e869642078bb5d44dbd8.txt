    Stoke boss Mark Hughes says that "two bizarre goals" decided the outcome of his side's 
    
1-1 draw with Southampton.
    Potters goal-keeper Asmir Begovic's opened the scoring on 13 seconds after his 97.5 yard clearance looped over Southampton stopper Artur Boruc. 
    But Jay Rodriguez levelled the scores, heading the ball down into the ground before watching it bounce over Begovic and into the net.
