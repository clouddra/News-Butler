David Moyes has suffered a double blow with two defenders ruled out of Manchester United’s Champions League clash with Real Sociedad.
• Payne: Injuries beset defence

Centre-back Jonny Evans has a back problem and right-back Rafael da Silva has an ankle injury and neither travelled to Spain.

Both were hurt in the first half of United’s 3-1 win over Fulham on Saturday and were substituted at the interval.

"We haven't had a lot of injuries," Moyes said. "I think it's the best Manchester United have been in that respect for a while. But we did pick up three on Saturday, which is very rare, especially by half-time. Two of them haven't travelled, Jonny Evans and Rafael, so they're not with us."

Midfielder Tom Cleverley was the third player Moyes removed at the break at Craven Cottage but the England international, who was suffering from double vision then, is available again for Tuesday’s match.

United have won their last four games in all competitions and top Group A in the Champions League with seven points from a possible nine.

A win in San Sebastian would take United to ten points, which is often enough to secure a place in the last 16.

And Moyes added: "I have a lot of respect for Sociedad. We have to play well if we’re going to get those 10 points, which will get us over the line.

"We've got ourselves into a good position in the group and we have to try to maintain that "I feel we're playing better and getting some good results to go with it. Long may that continue.”
