Nigel Worthington believes York can take a lot from their performance despite a 3-0 loss to Rotherham in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy.The Minstermen went into the cup tie fresh from back-to-back wins over Portsmouth and Torquay but could find no way back after Chris Smith put through his own net. Further strikes from Kieran Agard and Alex Revell put the result beyond any doubt.York had a host of chances and gave as good as they got in the first half. Worthington wants his players to concentrate on the positives rather than the negatives as they look to continue their good form in League Two."I thought our performance overall was very good," he said."We had a few good chances and I'm not so sure about the goal that was ruled out for offside in the first half. We competed well and had a real good go at them but they had the rub of the green on the night and we have to move on."It was a good performance and I can live with that. The league is our bread and butter and I've told the players if we perform like that in the league we won't be far away from winning matches."You've got to remember that Rotherham are in the division above us and they've got a good team. We'll build on the progress we've made in the past few weeks and not let it distract us from the last three results."
