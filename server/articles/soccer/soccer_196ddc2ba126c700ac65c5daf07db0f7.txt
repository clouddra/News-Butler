Hernanes has no intention of leaving Lazio in January and says he would be willing to discuss a contract extension.Speculation has suggested that the Brazil international could be on the move when the transfer window re-opens.The likes of Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur have all been credited with holding an interest in the 28-year-old midfielder.Hernanes, who has netted three times in 11 appearances this season, is paying little attention to the rumours, though, and claims he would be willing to talk with Lazio about fresh terms.He told Lazio Style Radio: "I want to deny all of those market rumours about me."I have a contract with Lazio and I want to respect it with the same passion and professionalism that I have had from the beginning."During training I do what is asked of me and more and I have played matches when I haven't been 100 per cent, taking risks."Extending my contract? I will never ask for a renewal. If the club thinks I deserve to stay here, they'll call me and we'll talk. I still have 18 months left and there are other players in the same situation."
