Millwall defender Scott Malone has escaped knee ligament damage but the club have refused to put a timescale on his return to the team.The left-back had a scan on Monday to determine the extent of the injury which forced him off just seven minutes into Saturday's 2-2 draw with Burnley.Physio Bobby Bacic revealed the positive news but was unwilling to say when the 22-year-old will be available for selection."Initial scan results on Scott have indicated that he has suffered no knee ligament or cartilage damage," Bacic told the club website."Due to the early stage of the injury it would be premature to give a predicted return to play, especially as we also want to double check the ankle as well."We are, however, pleased with the results so far."
