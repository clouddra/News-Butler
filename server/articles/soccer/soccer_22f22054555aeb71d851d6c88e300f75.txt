Freiburg goalkeeper Oliver BaumannWerder Bremen and Freiburg played out the first goalless draw in the Bundesliga this season.The goalless draw was a deserved outcome from a game in which both sides lacked invention and ambition, although Freiburg came the closest to victory when Matthias Ginter's effort hit the crossbar.The draw left Christian Streich's men still waiting for their first win of the season, while Bremen disappointed once again at home after a draw with Nurnberg and 3-0 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in their last two outings at the Weser Stadion.Robin Dutt, facing his former club for the first time as Bremen coach, brought former Freiburg midfielder Cedric Makiadi back into his team and the early signs were good.Clemens Fritz and Admir Mehmedi both had early efforts on goal before Nils Petersen was denied by Oliver Baumann.Aaron Hunt was next to be thwarted by the Freiburg goalkeeper before Sebastian Freis failed to get the better of Sebastian Mielitz at the other end.The woodwork came to Freiburg's rescue when the ball inadvertently struck Freis' back and came back off the outside of a post, but there was still no sign of a goal.Ginter, whose goal earned Freiburg victory the last time the two sides met, went closest to breaking the deadlock when his header from close range hit the bar.Baumann then came to the visitors' rescue to deny Petersen when one on one with the keeper.
