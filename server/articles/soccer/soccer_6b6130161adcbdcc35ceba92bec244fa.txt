Getafe eased past 10-man Granada 2-0 on Sunday to match a club record with a fourth consecutive win that kept the Madrid side close to the top four in La Liga.GettyImagesPedro Leon sealed the win for Getafe.Visiting Getafe were helped by a disastrous day for Granada's centre-backs, with one being sent off early and the other opening the scoring with an own goal.Pape Diakhate received his second yellow card in the 31st minute and defensive partner Jeison Murillo knocked Pedro Leon's cross into Granada's goal two minutes after half-time.Leon sealed the result for Getafe in the 55th with a first-touch strike from the edge of the area. Getafe climbed to within one point of fourth-place Villarreal before they play at Athletic Bilbao on Monday.Sevilla conceded two goals in the last 10 minutes to slip to a 2-2 draw at Valladolid. Sevilla dominated for 80 minutes after going in front from striker Carlos Bacca's precise strike after two minutes that Alberto Moreno doubled in the 31st with a long-range effort.Yet when it looked like Valladolid were done, substitute Manucho rose over his marker to head home a cross in the 81st minute, and three minutes later Patrick Ebert curled in a free-kick to split the points.Rayo Vallecano defender Alejandro Galvez's stinging free-kick in the 78th minute lifted his team to a 1-0 win over bottom club Almeria, who remain the only side in the top-flight without a win this season.Rayo appeared to be in trouble after defender Saul Niguez was dismissed for his second booking in the 65th minute. But Almeria failed to take advantage of the extra man before Galvez blasted a free-kick just inside the near corner of the upright to give Rayo their second win in a row.Elche built an early lead and held on after going down a man to edge Real Betis 2-1, giving the promoted side their third straight victory.Elche struck first in Seville when Manuel del Moral headed in Domingo Cisma's well-placed cross to meet his run at the first post in the 29th minute. Fidel Chivas extended Elche's lead five minutes later, only for Jorge Molina to pull one back for Betis just before the break.Elche resisted for almost the entire second half after Cisma saw a second yellow card a minute after the break.Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.
