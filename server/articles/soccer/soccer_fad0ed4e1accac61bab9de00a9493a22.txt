Alejandro Bedoya celebrates after scoring the only goal of the gameNantes scored late on to make it four wins in a row with a 1-0 win over Ajaccio in an uninspiring encounter at the Stade Francois Coty.Alejandro Bedoya's goal with just three minutes left of normal time was the difference between the two sides, both of whom lacked any real quality on the night.Defeat for Ajaccio means the hosts have only taken all three points just once this season and leaves them one place above the drop zone, and on goal difference alone.In a relatively quiet opening to the game, it was the visitors who managed to fashion the first opening with a quarter of an hour played.Issa Cissokho made space out at the right corner flag before picking out Serge Gakpe at the far post but, after rising above Laurent Bonnart, the Togolese midfielder failed to find the target with a header.Nantes continued to impress early on and Ajaccio keeper Guillermo Ochoa was called upon twice in quick succession, firstly pushing Birama Toure's first-time effort onto the crossbar before getting down to keep out Lucas Deaux's effort from outside the area.Ajaccio had to wait until just before the break for their first real opportunity on goal but Adrien Mutu's effort from outside the area was gathered by Remy Riou despite the ball bouncing awkwardly in front of the keeper.There was still time for Nantes' Toure to miss a glorious chance after Ochoa failed to gather a corner but the Mali midfielder headed into the side-netting from six yards and the scores remained goalless at the break.The interval did nothing to rejuvenate either side as both teams continued to struggle in front of goal.Mutu managed to muster another effort at goal with 10 minutes played in the second half but his effort from the penalty spot was easily gathered by Riou.The biggest opportunity so far came the hosts' way midway through the second half but, after being picked out superbly by Benoit Pedretti, Aboubacar Camara saw his shot kept out by a magnificent save from Nantes goalkeeper Riou.With the game seemingly petering out to a goalless draw it was left to American Bedoya to score the only goal of the game with just three minutes left on the clock.Filip Djordjevic broke down the left and the Serbian's delivery evaded Ochoa before landing at the feet of Bedoya, who was left with the simplest of finishes at the far post to steal all three points for the visitors.After taking just seven points from their first six games, promoted Nantes have surged to fourth in the table by virtue of their perfect record since then.
