Pablo Zabaleta believes Manchester City are well placed to emerge as one of Europe's elite clubs.Since Sheikh Mansour took control at the Etihad Stadium, City have become one of the dominant forces in English football, which included them winning the Premier League in 2012.However, European success has evaded them somewhat with a string of failures to their name in recent seasons.But Argentine ace Zabaleta believes things are about to change for City.




"We are still improving and hopefully in the next few years, we can be one of the top clubs in Europe."

We won the FA Cup, we won the Premier League, but the Champions League is different. You play against the best teams and it has not been easy."But now we are very positive and everything is set for this club to take a step forward."If we can qualify for the next round, it would be great for this club. We are still improving and hopefully in the next few years, we can be one of the top clubs in Europe."
