Nordsjaelland defender Jores Okore has revealed that he turned down the chance to join Chelsea in January.The Blues saw an offer for the highly-rated 20-year-old accepted, but were spurned by the player.Okore claims he snubbed the approach because first team football is of vital importance to him at this stage of his career, and he could have found himself stuck on the bench at Stamford Bridge.The Denmark international is eager to test himself at the highest possible level in the future, but insists he is happy to further his development in Scandinavia for now.Okore told TV2 Denmark: "I chose to turn it down (the Chelsea offer) as it did not fit the strategy I have for my future. My biggest wish is to play first team football and that was not something that was on the cards."Asked if he should have accepted the deal while the opportunity was there, he added: "Sure, if you are interested in the money, then it would have been the right decision."But I love to play football and I want to play football on a regular basis, so if I keep on impressing and playing then I am certain I can develop my game so I can play for Chelsea in the future."It was difficult turning down Chelsea, but it would also have been difficult turning down Manchester United."You have to think about your own future and I am only 20 years old. For me first team football is the priority. In a couple of years we can talk about money, big clubs and regular football there."
