Neil Lennon hopes the additional two games Scott Brown was banned for over his sending-off against Barcelona in the Champions League will be expunged next week.Brown's appeal is due to be held in Geneva over the next seven days with representations being made by Celtic and possibly the player himself.The Scotland captain was dismissed for flicking a leg out at Neymar after having fouled the Brazilian, and his conduct was deemed worthy of two extra games on top of the standard one-match ban he was given.He sat out the 2-1 win over Ajax in midweek but Lennon still feels the sanction was harsh and Brown, who will miss the reverse clash with Ajax and the visit of Milan if the appeal fails, might appear in person to argue the case."The appeal will be next week at some stage," he said. "I don't know if I am going over but there will be representation from the club and Scott as well."We would like him there, if he is going to go, to put his point across. He has a good disciplinary record and I think that should stand him in good stead."You can watch Celtic's next Scottish Premiership clash against Partick Thistle live on Sky Sports 4 on Sunday, with the programme starting at 12:30pm
