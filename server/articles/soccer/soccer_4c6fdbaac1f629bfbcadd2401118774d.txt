FC Dordrecht keeper Warner Hahn would be willing to discuss a move to Celtic, but only if he will be first choice.The Holland U21 international is currently plying his trade in the Dutch second tier, but he has ambitions to grace the very top of the game.A switch to Celtic would allow him to compete in the UEFA Champions League and further his claims to senior recognition with his country.Hahn believes he is capable of turning out at such a level, but acknowledges that he will need to be playing regularly if he is to hit his targets.A transfer to Celtic could be put in place for next summer, with Bhoys boss Neil Lennon having conceded that he will find it difficult to retain the services of England hopeful Fraser Forster.Hahn said in the Daily Record: "I would not join any club to be the number two keeper - I want to be number one."Of course Celtic might be thinking they will get offers for the very good goalkeeper they have now."But I certainly wouldn't accept being the number two keeper anywhere."My aim is to be the number one for the Dutch national team eventually - and of course if I am playing Champions League football that will give me a much greater chance."To play against teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich really tests your ability - and is great preparation for playing international football."I have heard about Celtic's interest in me and of course it's always nice to be linked with a move to such a big club."I have the option to move on in the summer so it will be interesting to see what offers I get."
