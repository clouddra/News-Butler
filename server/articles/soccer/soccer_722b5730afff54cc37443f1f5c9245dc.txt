Jimmy Briand (l) is congratulated on his late levellerJimmy Briand scored in time added on as the 10 men of Lyon salvaged a point in a 1-1 draw at home to Bordeaux.In a match-up of two teams well off the pace so far in Ligue 1, Bordeaux struck first when Ludovic Obraniak found the net just after the hour mark.Things got worse for the hosts when Alexandre Lacazette committed a second bookable offence six minutes later, but with the final whistle looming Briand prodded home from close range to snatch a point.After Cheick Diabate headed an early chance wide for the visitors, Lyon had the better of the first half but to no avail.Bafetimbi Gomis curled a shot towards goal from the edge of the area which Cedric Carrasso pushed away for a corner.There was another chance for Bordeaux when Henri Saivet fired narrowly wide, but Lyon quickly responded with a shot from Yassine Benzia which went narrowly over the crossbar.Carrasso had to make an excellent save to keep out Clement Grenier's 52nd minute free-kick, but it was Bordeaux who took the lead.It came in the 62nd minute when Saivet crossed from the left, picking out Obraniak who was able to find the space to pick his spot despite the close attentions of Mouhamadou Dabo and Mahamadou-Naby Sarr.Lyon were in danger of self-destructing when Lacazette pushed Marc Planus to earn a second yellow card in the 68th minute and Bordeaux appeared to have the match under control.Lyon threatened again in the 86th minute when Carrasso saved another Grenier free-kick, but the home fans were already filing out when they got their equaliser, Briand following up after Carrasso could only parry Nabil Fekir's shot.
