Gordon Strachan says there is no need to rush Steven Fletcher back into the Scotland team.The Sunderland striker is back in the national squad for this month's friendlies against Norway and the United States having not played for his country since suffering an ankle injury early on in the 2-1 World Cup qualifying defeat to Wales in March.And while Strachan is delighted to have him available, Steven Naismith's impressive form in the lone striker's role in his absence means the Scotland boss can take his time."We are delighted to have him back, obviously. Sunderland are delighted to have him back," said Strachan."Both of us need a good Steven Fletcher, which would add to our squad and definitely add to their squad as well. It's been a hard fight for him to get back but he has done great."He can add to what we have been doing already and if he surpasses what the boys have been doing up front in recent games, then that will be terrific."It will take him a wee while to get back to his best. If he's back to his best and he can do better than what we've had up front, then that will be a great bonus."If he's not back to his best, we can wait a bit because the other players playing up front now are playing quite well."So it's a not a mad rush, it's not desperate. It's great to have him back and I'm sure it will be a great feeling for him to be back."
