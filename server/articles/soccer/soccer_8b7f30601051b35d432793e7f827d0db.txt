Mark Hughes considers Asmir Begovic to be one of the world's top goalkeepers and is desperate to keep him at Stoke City.The Bosnia international is already one of the Premier League's most sought-after shot-stoppers after proving himself at Portsmouth and Stoke.The likes of Arsenal and Manchester United have been linked with his services in the past, but no deal has been done.Speculation is likely to intensify again once the January transfer window opens, with Begovic enjoying another consistent season with the Potters.Hughes is reluctant to part with the 26-year-old, but acknowledges that his performances for club and country continue to put him in the shop window.









"I'd like to work with Asmir for many, many seasons because I think he's that good."
