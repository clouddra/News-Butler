Atsuto Uchida and Nico Schulz battle for the ballAdam Szalai and Julian Draxler struck to earn Schalke all three points at Hertha Berlin on Saturday and give Jens Keller's men a confidence boost ahead of their trip to Chelsea in midweek.The Hungarian headed home in the first half before Draxler scored with the last kick of the game to earn the Royal Blues a 2-0 win which lifts them up to fifth in the Bundesliga table.Hertha probably did enough to get a point from the game but, in front of their biggest home crowd of the season, they were unable to find a goal as they let the Royal Blues overtake them in the standings.Hertha coach Jos Luhukay kept faith with the side which had caused Bayern Munich plenty of problems last weekend while Max Meyer was rewarded for his lively entrance against Borussia Dortmund a week ago by starting for Schalke.There was not so much liveliness in the way Schalke started the game, though, with Hertha Berlin quick to take charge.Anis Ben-Hatira caused plenty of problems early on and his shot from the edge of the penalty area had Timo Hildebrand at full stretch to keep out in the 12th minute.Schalke soaked up the pressure before attacking themselves with Draxler's shot pushed wide and Szalai going close from the corner, earning another corner from the other side which proved decisive.The Hungarian rose highest at the near post to meet Dennis Aogo's cross to head Schalke in front.Hertha did not fall apart after conceding, although it was not until early in the second half that they managed to cause Hildebrand any problems, Ben-Hatira unsurprisingly the provider of the danger.Substitute Ronny also tested the Schalke goalkeeper as Hertha began to build up a head of steam.At the other end, they nearly gave away a penalty when Szalai went to ground in the area after reaching Draxler's throughball, but the referee waved away their appeals.Draxler had the final say, though, with a low shot from 20 yards out which beat Thomas Kraft and sealed Schalke's victory in the fourth minute of stoppage time.
