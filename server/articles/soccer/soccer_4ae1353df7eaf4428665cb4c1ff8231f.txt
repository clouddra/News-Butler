David Flitcroft: Barnsley boss could name unchanged sideBarnsley manager David Flitcroft could name an unchanged starting line-up for Saturday's Sky Bet Championship clash with Sheffield Wednesday at Oakwell.Flitcroft has no new injury or suspension problems as the Reds look to build on last week's home win over Middlesbrough - their first in seven league matches.Goalkeeper Luke Steele remains sidelined with a back problem so Stoke loanee Jack Butland will continue, while Flitcroft must decide whether to stick with Jean Yves Mvoto in the absence of Peter Ramage (thigh) or recall Bobby Hassell.Marcus Pedersen returned from a foot injury to partner Chris O'Grady last week and that pairing will resume up front, while midfielders Jim O'Brien and Tomasz Cywka are pushing for recalls.Sheffield Wednesday, meanwhile, will be without suspended midfielder Jose Semedo for the derby clash.Wednesday were unsuccessful with their appeal against Semedo's straight red card in last week's draw at Bolton and the Portuguese starts a three-game ban.Liam Palmer could return to the starting line-up in Semedo's absence, but otherwise manager Dave Jones has no selection issues as his side chase their first win of the season.Striker Matty Fryatt will play his last game before his scheduled return to parent club Hull, while Jones must decide whether to stick with Kamil Zayatte at the heart of defence or recall Miguel Llera.
