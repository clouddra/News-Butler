Dagenham first-team coach Darren Currie felt his side's belief enabled them to see off Southend 5-2 in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy.The Daggers netted four goals in the space of seven second-half minutes to see off the Shrimpers.That made it seven games without defeat and delighted Currie."Southend got back into the game in the second half but we have great belief in this squad at the moment and we never stop going which is why we came back so strongly," Currie said."It was a very exciting match and Wayne (Burnett, Daggers boss) decided to make one or two changes to give some players a chance and they all put a shift in and played excellently."It was a smashing header from Brian Saah to bring the equaliser and it lifted the whole team and gave us the momentum to push on and get more."All of the players here want to score goals and we work on finishing a lot in training and it is good to see them all playing on the front foot."We say to them to always expect a mistake and two of them got goals from that."The league is our main focus but it is always our aim to keep the form going and that is what we did here at a difficult place to come to."
