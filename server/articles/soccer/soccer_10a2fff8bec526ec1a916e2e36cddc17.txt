Coventry manager Steven Pressley was full of praise for his players after their 1-1 draw against high-flying Wolves at Molineux.Leigh Griffiths looked to have put Wanderers on course for a ninth win in 10 league games with his eighth goal of the season in the 67th minute, only for substitute Aaron Phillips to earn City a deserved 1-1 draw four minutes from time."I thought we gave a very, very mature performance," Pressley said. "The players gave their absolute lot."It was an incredible performance and an incredible attitude from the group and I am truly proud of that."It was a great game of football actually, a very intense game, a proper game, on the edge. It would have been a travesty if we had not taken anything from it."Even when we scored I felt we could get the winner, I really did. I felt we were the team on the front foot at that stage of the game and I was hopeful we could get that winner."But it was a wonderful performance from every single player."I talk a lot about the team and giving yourself to the team and each and every player gave themselves to the team."They were so unselfish in their work, they covered back for each other and when someone was out of position they recovered for that player. It was a wonderful team effort."
