Jim Bentley was delighted to see striker Jack Redshaw make his Morecambe comeback ahead of schedule at the weekend.Last season's top scorer for the Shrimps underwent hip surgery in the summer and it was feared he would be ruled out until at least Christmas.But Redshaw has been back in training for a couple of weeks now and boss Bentley made what he labelled "a gamble" by introducing the 22-year-old for the last four minutes in the 1-0 win over Burton.Redshaw is expected to feature for Morecambe's reserves in the clash at Oldham this week, and Bentley told The Visitor: "Maybe it was a gamble, but he'd trained well and will play for the reserves on Tuesday."He's looking sharp, he's looking fit in training."We gave him eight minutes or whatever it was. I thought with two centre-halves tiring in the game, both on bookings, loads of space in behind, we've seen Jack come off the bench and be a real outlet for us."It might have been a little bit early for him because he was really blowing after a minute or two, but he's been out for that long."We've got to monitor him and manage him and get him right back to where we want him to be."It's great psychologically for him to be back as well as for the fans, which you could see from the reaction he got. It's just brilliant to see him back on the pitch."On his Twitter account after the match on Saturday, Redshaw said: "Thanks for all the messages, feels great to get some minutes on the pitch.. Great win & 3 points."
