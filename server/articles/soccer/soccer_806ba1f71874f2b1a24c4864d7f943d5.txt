Scott went on loan to East Fife, he was desperate to play. His attitude has got him where he is today."Fox, 26 years old, left Parkhead in 2010 and joined Thistle later the same year after brief spells with Queen of the South and Dundee.

If he's not back to his best, we can wait a bit because the other players playing up front now are playing quite well."
