Celta Vigo celebrate against SevillaCelta Vigo claimed a 1-0 win over Sevilla after Alex Lopez capitalised on an error by goalkeeper Beto in the Primera Division clash at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan on Saturday.Lopez struck in the 47th minute after the Sevilla keeper made a complete hash of a clearance as he put the ball at the feet of the Celta midfielder, who beat him one-on-one to fire home.The result, Celta's third league win of the season, lifted them up into 13th place in the overall standings, one point adrift of Sevilla who are 11th.The defeat was another blow for Sevilla following their 7-3 thrashing by Real Madrid in midweek.The game started at a good tempo and Beto was called into action early on when he punched Augusto Fernandez's second-minute effort clear.Nolito's shot was then blocked by Sevilla midfielder Stephane Mbia before Charles' shot was saved by Beto as Celta had all of the early chances.Mbia tried his luck at the other end but his header went wide before Celta's Santi Mina almost put the visitors ahead when his close-range strike hit the bar in the 20th minute.Vitolo then fired over for Sevilla as both sides failed to find a cutting edge in the first half.However, things quickly changed after the break when that glaring error by Beto and some quick thinking from Lopez saw the visitors go ahead.With a goal-kick to take and under no real pressure whatsoever, Beto messed up his clearance and instead played the ball directly to Lopez who was only 10 yards away.The Celta midfielder only had to round the keeper, which he did despite the stopper's best efforts to distract him, to slot into the empty net and give his side a shock lead.Mbia had the best chance to level for Sevilla when his strike from the middle of the area struck the post, but the home side were unable to unlock the Celta defence and fell to their second successive defeat.
