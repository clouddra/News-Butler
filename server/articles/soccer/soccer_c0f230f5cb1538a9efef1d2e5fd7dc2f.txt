Queens Park Rangers are keeping a close eye on Australia and Melbourne Victory star Mark Milligan.According to local reports, Rangers will be sending a scout to run the rule over the versatile defender when the Socceroos take on Iraq next Tuesday in Sydney.The 27 year-old still has two years remaining on his current contract with Melbourne but could leave the club if the right offer came along.His agent Buddy Farah told foxsports.com.au that while a dream move to Europe could be on the cards this summer, he is happy to stay put for the time being."Mark's very happy at Melbourne and should an offer come in from Europe that we believed suited him we could be interested, but we're not chasing anything, it's all coming to us," said Farah.Milligan, who recently turned down a $2 million offer to play for UAE's Baniyas, was close to joining Arsenal in 2008 but that deal fell through.
