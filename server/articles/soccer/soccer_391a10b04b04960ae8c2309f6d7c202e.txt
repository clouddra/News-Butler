Alvaro Negredo believes that he can lead the line for Spain if he keeps up his form for Manchester City.The Spaniard has impressed since his summer move from Sevilla, scoring three goals from five Premier League starts.He helped Spain top their World Cup, scoring in the wins over Belarus and Georgia earlier this month, and is now seemingly in pole position to start for his country at the finals next year."I am convinced if I keep playing like this for City I can be the top striker in the Spain team at the World Cup," he told the Daily Star."The manager has demanded goals from me and that is my target."To be the main striker at City is just as difficult as it is for Spain."But I will fight hard as I can to make it happen, my challenge at City is to win titles, I think that this year we are contenders for the league."
