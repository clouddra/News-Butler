    Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says Sir Alex Ferguson's comments in his latest autobiography that Steven Gerrard is not a "top, top player" are 
    
not "credible".
    The former Manchester United manager could be "the only one" who thinks that, claims the Reds boss.
    Gerrard scored his 100th Premier League goal on Saturday and has registered at least one strike in each of the last 15 Premier League seasons.
