Manchester United boss David Moyes has called on Roy Hodgson to give Wayne Rooney a rest ahead of next month's friendlies against Chile and Germany.Moyes believes it could be the perfect time to hand the striker a breather to ensure he is fit and firing for next summer's World Cup finals in Brazil.England take on Chile on November 15 before taking on Germany four days later and with United facing six matches in three weeks before the friendlies, Moyes feels Rooney should be excused from international action."If we want a fit and firing Wayne Rooney at the World Cup it might be better giving him a week's holiday," said Moyes."England have one more international after Christmas against Denmark in March so this might be the one to rest him."A lot of coaches will look at their players and see the November internationals as the last time to get any decent rest."I think he [Hodgson] might try and be fair with some clubs."But there is no point in friendlies if you're not going to use them to prepare for the World Cup."
