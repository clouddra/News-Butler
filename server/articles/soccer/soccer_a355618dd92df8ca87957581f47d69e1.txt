England manager Roy Hodgson has dismissed claims the UEFA Champions League has grown bigger than the World Cup.PA PhotosRoy Hodgson has defended the standard of international football.â€¢ Smith: International mythHodgson's Three Lions side qualified for Brazil 2014 during the recent international break. However, their qualification came amid claims that Europe's top club competition is now the pinnacle of world football.It is an argument which Hodgson believes carries little weight."That must be propaganda from the Champions League," he said. "I think you will find most players, at the end of their careers, would say going to the World Cup was their best moment."Not many will be saying it was playing in the group stages of the Champions League against Standard Liege on a Wednesday night."That is not to say Hodgson has no time for the Champions League. Just that, in his view, there is no comparison with a tournament that rivals the Olympic Games as the biggest show on earth."Statements that the Champions League knocks the World Cup into a cocked hat knock me for six," he said."I like the Champions League. It is a great competition. But the World Cup is often described, in sporting terms, as the greatest show on earth."It is certainly watched by the most number of people, there is no question about that."Information from the Press Association was used in this report.
