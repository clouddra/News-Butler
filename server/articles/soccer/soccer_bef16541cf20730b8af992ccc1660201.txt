    Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini says he is saddened that racist chanting has happened again at a football match.

City midfielder Yaya Toure has called for Uefa to act, 

     claiming he was the subject of racist chants by home fans during his side's 
    
2-1 victory at CSKA Moscow.
    Pellegrini says he did not hear the chants but called them "stupid" and "a pity".
