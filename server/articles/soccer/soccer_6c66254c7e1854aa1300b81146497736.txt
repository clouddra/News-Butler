Jack Butland admits he had 'a few options' to consider over the summer, but believes a short-term deal at Barnsley can aid his World Cup quest.With it clear that staying on at parent employers Stoke City would see him restricted to a supporting role, Butland took the decision early to put a loan agreement in place.Unsurprisingly, several clubs expressed an interest in taking a goalkeeper who has earned senior international recognition and has captained the England U21 side this season.It was, however, to be Barnsley who secured a much-coveted signature, with Butland set to remain at Oakwell until Boxing Day.The Tykes have endured a difficult start to their 2013/14 Championship campaign, and currently prop up the division, but Butland is convinced that the experiences he will take from his time at the foot of the second tier will stand him in good stead as he tries to earn a place in Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad for Brazil 2014.He said in the Barnsley Chronicle: "The target is to get to Brazil. It will be difficult to get there unless I'm playing regularly and playing well."I had a few options but I came to Barnsley because it's a challenge that will improve me more than any other. I might get more to do than going somewhere higher in the league. There's more decisions for me to make and more saves for me to make."It will be much more satisfying to help get this team away from the drop zone in my three months here than it would be to perhaps be around the play-offs. I've enjoyed my time here so far."
