    Cardiff City boss Malky Mackay is "delighted" with his side's "special" 
    
1-0 victory over Welsh rivals Swansea.
    Steven Caulker's second-half header was enough to give Cardiff victory over 10-man Swansea in the two side's first ever Premier League meeting.
    It is 17 years since a south Wales derby was decided by more than a one-goal difference. In 1996 Swansea beat Cardiff 3-1 in the Football League Division Three.
