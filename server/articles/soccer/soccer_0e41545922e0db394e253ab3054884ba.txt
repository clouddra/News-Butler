The Football Association could face disciplinary action from FIFA over its failure to prevent Poland supporters from setting off flares during the 2014 World Cup qualifier against England earlier this month.GettyImagesThe Polish Football Association could also face sanctions.The Polish Football Association could also face sanctions after 16 fans were arrested in Wembley’s away section for lighting pyrotechnics before and during England’s 2-0 win on Oct. 15.Despite no England fans reportedly being involved in the controversy, FIFA regulations state that the host governing body is liable for the conduct and security of both sets of fans inside the stadium.A FIFA statement read: "We can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the Football Association and the Polish Football Association for incidents that were reported during the preliminary competition match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil between England and Poland on Oct. 15 2013."The FA has stepped up its efforts with the Premier League to stop flares and smoke bombs entering stadiums after a linesman was hit by a flare in Tottenham’s 2-0 victory over Aston Villa at Villa Park on Sunday.The issue is a growing concern around English grounds after there were more than 130 reported incidents of pyrotechnic use last season.An FA spokesman said: “The FA remains concerned about the issue of pyrotechnics being brought into and used at football grounds.“Aside from the inherent dangers of using such devices, it is important to stress that it is a criminal offence to bring, or attempt to bring, a pyrotechnic device into a football ground."Offenders who are arrested and convicted could receive a fine and most likely a Football Banning Order or possibly a jail sentence.”
