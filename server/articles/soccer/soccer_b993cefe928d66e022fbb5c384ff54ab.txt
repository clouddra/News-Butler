James Forrest (l): Doubtful for CelticJames Forrest and Charlie Mulgrew are doubtful for Celtic's Scottish Premiership
derby clash with Partick Thistle at Firhill on Sunday.Forrest has an ankle problem and Mulgrew is nursing a heel injury, but midfielder Beram Kayal (thigh) should be available.Defender Mikael Lustig is expected to shrug off a hip problem, while captain Scott Brown comes back in after missing the Champions League game against Ajax in midweek through suspension.Derk Boerrigter (ankle) should join up with the squad for training on Monday while Kris Commons' hamstring strain will keep him out until next weekend.Mark Kerr is a serious doubt for Partick as he struggles to overcome a back complaint and Gary Fraser is suspended after being sent off in an under-20 game in midweek.The game against the Hoops comes too early for Jordon McMillan who is still on his way back to full fitness after a thigh injury.You can watch Celtic's Scottish Premiership clash against Partick Thistle live on Sky Sports 4 on Sunday, with the programme starting at 12:30pm.
