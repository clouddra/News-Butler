Former Paris St Germain sporting director Leonardo could soon return to the game after his season-long suspension was put on hold.The French Football Federation (FFF) imposed an initial penalty, until early February, after Leonardo pushed a referee following a Ligue 1 clash with Valenciennes on May 5.An appeal backfired when the suspension was lengthened to keep him sidelined until June 30, 2014.Leonardo left the French champions in July, having had his influence reduced by the conditions of the ban, which meant he was to be barred from appearing on the touchline or entering referees' dressing rooms after matches.He took his case to the administrative court in Paris, and was informed on Tuesday that the argument that he was not subject to FFF justice - as he was not affiliated to the federation by a coaching licence - had been upheld to the point where the suspension has been temporarily lifted.A further hearing is planned to determine Leonardo's fate definitively, according to Le Parisien.One of Leonardo's legal representatives, Paul Mauriac, told the newspaper: "He is happy, relieved, and knows he has conducted a legitimate battle. His persistence was rewarded. It was a key step."Leonardo as a player was a World Cup winner with Brazil in 1994.
