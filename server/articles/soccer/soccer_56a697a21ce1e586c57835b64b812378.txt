    Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger thinks 
    
Jack Wilshere's goal in the 4-1 victory over Norwich 

     last Saturday was a better strike than that of 
    
Fulham's Pajtim Kasami, who netted a spectacular volley 

     for Fulham in Monday's 4-1 win at Crystal Palace.
    Wilshere's calm finish, coming after a fine passing interchange involving several players, was "more difficult" to score than Kasami's effort according to Wenger, who believes "many players in the Premier League" could score a goal like Kasami's.
    On Saturday, Arsenal visit Palace, 
    
who parted company with manager Ian Holloway this week. 

     Wenger says the change is "very harsh" on Holloway.
