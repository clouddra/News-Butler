England will play friendly matches with fellow World Cup qualifiers Germany and Chile at Wembley next month.Chile will provide Roy Hodgson's men with a stern test on Friday, November 15, four days before Joachim Low brings Germany to London for another showpiece friendly to mark the Football Association's 150th anniversary celebration.They qualified for the World Cup with a 2-1 win over Ecuador in Santiago on Tuesday, securing their spot at a second successive tournament for the first time since 1966.A number of players with experience of British football could be in their line-up, with Nottingham Forest defender Gonzalo Jara, Cardiff's Gary Medel and Wigan winger Jean Beausejour all in their most recent squad.Hodgson was keen to take on South American opposition in one of the November friendlies, and Uruguay had been lined up for that date, but they have more important business, needing to beat Jordan to play their way into the World Cup via the play-offs.Chile's last visit to Wembley provided their sole win over England in five meetings, with legendary striker Marcelo Salas scoring both goals in a 2-0 success in 1998.England's footballing history with Germany is far more rich, but it will be their first visit to Wembley since 2007 when they were 2-1 winners over a team coached by Steve McClaren.The most recent meeting is one most England players and supporters will want to forget, the 4-1 thrashing at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa that ended Fabio Capello's hopes of winning the tournament in the last 16 and featured Frank Lampard's disallowed 'goal' that re-opened the goal-line technology debate.Low's side had little trouble qualifying for the World Cup finals next summer, dominating Group C with nine wins and a draw from their 10 games.They concluded their qualifying campaign with a 5-3 win over Sweden with their team including recent Arsenal signing Mesut Ozil and Chelsea forward Andre Schurrle, who helped himself to a hat-trick.
