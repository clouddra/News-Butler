Fiorentina midfielder Borja Valero is happy in Italy and paying little attention to reports of interest from afar.The former West Brom schemer has caught the eye since swapping life at Villarreal for that in Serie A in August 2012.His performances have not gone unnoticed, with Inter Milan and Real Madrid among those said to be closely monitoring his progress.Valero is a product of Real's famed academy system and admits there is one club in Spain that could tempt him back to his homeland, but for now, the 28-year-old is doing his best to ignore the rumours and has refused to rule out the possibility of agreeing an extended stay in Florence.He told Il Corriere dello Sport: "What do I feel about interest from big clubs. I don't know, maybe they have been wrong about me in the past."Fiorentina have turned down â‚¬20m for me? Really? I wouldn't pay that for me."A return to Real Madrid? I'm satisfied here. I'm fine at Fiorentina."There are only two teams that could tempt me if an offer was made, one is Spanish and the other is European. But dreams are not to be revealed and, anyway, they aren't thinking about me."I still have a three-year contract with Fiorentina. Could I extend that deal? Why not."
