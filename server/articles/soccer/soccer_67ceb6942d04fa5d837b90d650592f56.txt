Feyenoord boss Ronald Koeman has admitted that Bruno Martins Indi may have to be sold amid speculation linking the defender with a move to the Premier League.Reports suggest that he is a transfer target for Everton, while he is understood to have previously attracted the interest of several other clubs.Koeman does not want to block the progress of a player who appears destined for the very top of the game, and says Feyenoord are prepared to listen to offers.The Eredivisie club are also open to the idea of letting a couple of their other squad members leave."Sometimes you can't stand in the way of a player who needs a bigger stage to develop into a world-class player," Koeman said, quoted in the Sunday Mirror."We have two or three players who we may have to sell, and Bruno is one of them."
