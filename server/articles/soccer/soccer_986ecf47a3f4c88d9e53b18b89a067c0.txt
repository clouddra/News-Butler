    BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.
Susanna Reid's Focus predictions    This week he takes on BBC Breakfast's Susanna Reid and her 
    
Strictly Come Dancing 

     partner Kevin Clifton.
    Reid is a big Crystal Palace fan who had a season ticket at Selhurst Park in the 1995-96 season, and has been on the pitch herself in the last couple of weeks.
    "I have some brilliant memories of watching Palace in some fantastic venues," Reid said. "I still make the occasional visit, but being on Strictly means Saturday games have been rather interrupted.
    "Even so, I had the chance to go and practise some moves at Selhurst Park earlier this month. 
    "We were doing the Viennese Waltz and what we needed was a lot of space to glide, so Kev thought that would be the perfect place to expand - and be inspired by an amazing football team."
    Clifton has supported Scunthorpe United all his life but he also follows Chelsea because his dad is a fan of the Blues and said: "He really wanted to call me Osgood Clifton after Peter Osgood, but my mum was not having any of it!"

    Fulham fans are still chasing Martin Jol 
    
despite his side's late win over Stoke in their last game. 

     That was a big result for Jol and I still think he is a good manager. Hopefully his job is safe too.
    I read an interview with Cottagers owner Shahid Khan recently and I liked what he said. He owns the Jackonsville Jaguars NFL franchise in the US too, so he knows how unpredictable sport can be.
    "Ian is a legend. Such a charismatic, brilliant. lovely person and he does those extraordinary dance moves too. 
    "He made an enormous number of new signings in the summer and that team has got to gel together because at the moment they are playing like a load of individuals. 
    "We are not winning but everyone has confidence in Holloway. I think he is going to get that team together and we are going to come back fighting. 
    "To all those people who think Palace are going to go straight back down, as we have done every time before in the Premier League, I think this season is going to be different and it is going to be down to Ian Holloway."
    I think he knows Jol is a good manager too. Khan did not appoint Jol, which is always a problem, but I am hopeful he will just leave him in there.
    Palace have lost four games in a row now, and I think Fulham will make it five.
    Eagles boss Ian Holloway is a good manager but his problem is that all of his players need to play well in order to get any sort of positive result. 
    It seems like every week at the moment one section of their team is letting them down.
    That could happen to them in the Championship and they could get away with it - they might not concede. In the Premier League, you get punished.
     Lawro's prediction:

     1-2
     Reid's prediction:

     "Palace are on a run of four defeats but at home I think this is the moment we bounce back. I think it is going to be a tightly fought game and it is going to be 3-2 to Palace."
     Clifton's prediction: 

    1-0.
