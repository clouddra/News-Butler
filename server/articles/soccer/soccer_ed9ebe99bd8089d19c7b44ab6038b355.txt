Steven Pienaar believes he and Leighton Baines are starting to build 'rhythm' again down Everton's left flank.The pair have struck up a productive understanding, with their interplay causing Premier League defences nightmares.Pienaar's creativity has blossomed alongside Baines' tireless running and willingness to offer attacking support whenever possible.Their partnership was broken for two months earlier this season as Pienaar endured a frustrating stint on the treatment table, but they have been reunited of late and are closing in on their brilliant best once more.Pienaar told the Liverpool Echo: "The way we combine sometimes, it's about split-second decision making, it's the timing.




"In the end, 0-0 against one of the teams also pushing for a Champions League spot is not the end of the world."

"In the end, 0-0 against one of the teams also pushing for a Champions League spot is not the end of the world."Steven Pienaar"It's coming back, but I'm still getting into the rhythm of it."It's only my third game back from eight weeks off so it's taking a while."I was happy to get the 96 minutes against Spurs and my fitness is getting much better. It will take a while but I'm getting there."Baines and Pienaar were unable to provide a goal-scoring spark against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, but positives are being taken from a hard-fought goalless draw at Goodison Park.Pienaar added: "Thankfully we were much better second half and created more and more chances, even if they weren't all clear openings."We couldn't get close to them in the first half. The gaffer wanted us to put pressure on from the word go, but we were always a bit off the pace. We were always a few seconds too late to close down."Second half we didn't let them start from the back as much. That's what we did much better."In the end, 0-0 against one of the teams also pushing for a Champions League spot is not the end of the world."The game could have gone either way. They had a good penalty shout and so did we. We'll take the positives of the second half."
