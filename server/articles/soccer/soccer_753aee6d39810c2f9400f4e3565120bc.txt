Danish defender Jores Okore fears that his long-awaited summer move could fall through due to the fact that the FC Nordsjaelland has increased the asking price after a good run in the Champions League.Okore has his heart set on leaving the Danish club after impressing in the Champions League, with his breakthrough appearance coming again Chelsea last year in October, where Okore did well against striker Fernando Torres.The 20-year-old defender has previously been linked to a host of Premier League clubs but despite his willingness to leave he has yet been offered a way out. He now fears that the club's valuation has deterred interest."If the clubs don't think that I've been good enough in the last couple of months then I would be disappointed as I have proven myself in the last two and a half years in the Danish league," Okore told sporten.dk."I can understand that the club has tried to raise the price and squeeze af much money out of a potential deal as possible."And I guess that shows that FC Nordsjaelland believes that they would have a hard time replacing me. I take that as a compliment but I hope that they can be realistic about the valuation so I can leave."
