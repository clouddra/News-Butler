Bruno Pereirinha jumps high for the ballGenoa ended Lazio's unbeaten run at the Stadio Olimpico with a 2-0 triumph on Sunday afternoon.Juraj Kucka put the visitors ahead on the hour mark before Alberto Gilardino made netted from the penalty spot following a handball from Lazio defender Michael Ciani.The outcome, Genoa's second win on the road this season, lifted the Grifoni to eighth position, one place and one point adrift of Lazio.The hosts went into the game nowhere near full strength with six players, including four defenders, ruled out through injury.However, Lazio dominated the opening half but failed to beat inspired Genoa goalkeeper Mattia Perin.Perin was called to make his first save of the afternoon midway through the first half when Miroslav Klose's header from Bruno Pereirinha's cross was kept out by the Genoa keeper.Shortly after, Perin was forced to fully stretch to clear Antonio Candreva's free-kick towards the far post.Candreva was again denied by Perin on the stroke of half-time with the keeper doing well to clear his 30-yard attempt.After the break Genoa took control and went ahead on 60 minutes.Ioannis Fetfatzidis fed Kucka in the box and his left-footed shot beat Lazio goalkeeper Federico Marchetti.The home side twice had the chance to level the score but Candreva and Stefan Radu each failed to find the target from a good position.Genoa extended their lead in the 71st minute.Gilardino stepped up to take the penalty and fired a right-footed shot to the centre of goal and out of Marchetti's reach.Klose came close to reducing the arrears in the 77th minute but his poweful header was saved by Perin.Genoa held on to record their third victory in five games since coach Gian Piero Gasperini returned to the club last month.
