Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has urged his team-mates to continue their momentum on the Champions League stage next week.The Argentine bagged a stunning double in Saturday's 3-1 win at West Ham and their next task is a crucial showdown at CSKA Moscow.City's bruising home defeat by Bayern Munich means they will drop to third in Group D if they lose in Moscow and, after two years of failure in Europe's elite competition, Aguero is desperate to avoid being knocked out of the group stages again."We have to win, don't we?" Aguero told City TV. "It's an important three points because then we play them at home. We won against West Ham away in the Premier League and now we have to win away in Moscow as well.

"We hope that UEFA allowed them to play the game there because it is a good pitch."
