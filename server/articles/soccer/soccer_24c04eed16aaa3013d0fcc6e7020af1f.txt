Holders AZ Alkmaar and 18-time winners Ajax survived extra-time scares to reach the third round of the KNVB Beker.AZ and Sparta were inseparable after 90 minutes, with Aron Johannsson's fifth-minute opener matched three minutes later by Johan Voskamp. But Johansson scored twice in the additional half-hour to complete a hat-trick and Steven Berghuis netted late on to earn a 4-1 win.Ajax also limped through to the 90-minute mark at 1-1 against Volendam as Lucas Andersen's 27th-minute goal was countered by Robert Muhren midway through the second half.Muhren put Volendam ahead in extra-time but Ajax powered back to take a 4-2 victory, courtesy of two goals from Lasse Schone and one from Danny Hoesen.PSV Eindhoven also hit four - beating Telstar 4-1 - but they too were unconvincing for a while.Telstar went ahead when Diangi Matusiwa netted in the ninth minute, and it took PSV until the 40th minute to haul themselves level in front of their home crowd, as Florian Jozefzoon plundered the equaliser.Jurgen Locadia took over from there, scoring a hat-trick that included goals right at the end of each half.Early Eredivisie high-flyers PEC Zwolle beat Fortuna Sittard 2-0, with Rochdi Achenteh and Joost Broerse on target.Roda JC beat Rijnsburgse Boys 2-1, Elson Hooi grabbed the winner as NAC Breda came from behind to edge out Smitshoek by the same score, Jens Toornstra scored twice as Utrecht defeated Den Bosch 4-1, Groningen beat AFC 2-0, and Vitesse were 3-1 victors over RVVH.
