Nigel Worthington has called on his York side to move on quickly from their 3-0 thumping at York.The defeat leaves the Minstermen in 18th place in League Two, just two points above the relegation zone, and they now face a trip to leaders Chesterfield on Tuesday night.Nigel Worthington said: "I don't think we played as well as we can do, we huffed and puffed a bit."Their first goal came from a chance for us at one end when Josh (Carson) missed an open goal and that sort of summed the day up for us."I can't question the endeavour or commitment of my players but the three goals were not good goals to concede."We are very disappointed with those and we have had our feet put firmly back on the ground."But we can't dwell on it because we've got a big game again on Tuesday."
