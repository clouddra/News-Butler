AZ Alkmaar have confirmed the shock departure of coach Gertjan Verbeek - just a day after he guided the club to victory over Eredivisie leaders PSV Eindhoven.In a statement, the AZ board pointed to a "lack of chemistry" between the coach and his squad as the reason for his sudden exit.AZ sit fourth in the league standings in the wake of Saturday's 2-1 win over PSV and are contesting the group stages of the Europa League, with a game to come against PAOK on Thursday."Coach Gertjan Verbeek leaves AZ with immediate effect," read a statement on club website az.nl."Based on a lack of chemistry between players and the head coach resulting in a lack of confidence, the management and supervisory board sees no more basis for further co-operation."The 51-year-old joined AZ in 2010 and signed a contract extension through to 2015 just last summer.He has secured European qualification in each of his three full seasons at the club - twice after finishing in fourth place in the league and again by winning the KNVB Beker last season.The club statement did not announce who would replace Verbeek, but a press conference this afternoon is expected to shed further light on the surprise development.
