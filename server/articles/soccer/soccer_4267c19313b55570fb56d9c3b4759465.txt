    Sunderland manager Gus Poyet says Sunday's Premier League derby against Newcastle is "the perfect game to start winning".
    The Uruguayan admits his new team must 
    
"improve dramatically" 

     to get a result but is aware of the "unique" atmosphere around the game.
    A reporter reminds Poyet that only last season a new manager in his second game at Sunderland beat Newcastle 3-0 in the derby and Poyet says he hopes to repeat Paolo Di Canio's feat.
