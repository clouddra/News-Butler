Rotherham manager Steve Evans believes the refereeing of his side's matches is going from bad to worse.The Millers feel they have been on the wrong end of several match-defining decisions in recent weeks, ranging from penalties not been given to receiving red cards.Tuesday's draw with Tranmere was again overshadowed by two questionable decisions, with referee Tony Harrington denying them a clear spot-kick for a handball before opting to only book Cole Stockton after he appeared to elbow Joe Skarz.Evans doubts there is an agenda against his side, but insists they are not getting correct decisions."It can't be an agenda against me because I keep winning promotion don't I?" Evans said. "But we seem to be on the wrong end of a lot of decisions."You look at the consistency and there's one part of the decisions which is clearly consistent - everything is against us."I saw a couple of weeks ago, Swindon wrote to the FA asking for protection for their players, somebody needs to write from here to look at the referee decisions we are getting."It just seems to be going from bad to worse and we seem to be attracting them at the minute."
