    Former chairman Peter Ridsdale says a lack of logic has afflicted the club's recent running.
    An off-field controversy erupted when current owner Vincent Tan replaced 
    
head of recruitment Iain Moody 

     with a 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov, who has 
    
stepped aside temporarily over a visa issue.
    Ridsdale says Moody was boss Malky Mackay's right-hand man.
    "There doesn't appear to be a lot of logic," said Ridsdale.

“The hardest thing in football is to get the right manager”
    "You've got the best young manager there, he's got his own staff - football managers need and want their own staff.
    "And then suddenly he's got his right-hand man taken away from him and somebody who doesn't appear to have any qualifications put in place.
    "So I think the football world have been raising their eyebrows at a time when, frankly, Cardiff City could do without that sort of publicity."
    Mackay guided the Bluebirds to a 1-0 win over arch-rivals Swansea in the Premier League on Sunday.
    Ridsdale hopes Malaysian businessman Tan gives his full backing to Mackay, who has been linked with possible moves to Fulham and Norwich.
    "The hardest thing in football is to get the right manager," Ridsdale told Radio Wales Sport.
    "Cardiff City have got the right manager and therefore I would appeal to everybody concerned… from Vincent [Tan] downwards to back the manger while he's there.
    "Because frankly you'll only realise how good he is if he goes."
