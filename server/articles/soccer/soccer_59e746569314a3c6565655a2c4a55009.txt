Al Ain have no intention of letting UAE star Omar Abdulrahman join Arsenal on a one-week trial but are prepared to entertain outright transfer bids.Last week, the Emirati outfit are reported to have received an official letter from Arsenal inviting the 21-year-old to train at their London Colney base ahead of a possible move.But Al Ain chairman Sheikh Abdullah bin Mohammed says Abdulrahman does not need to show his qualities in unnecessary trial stints and the club will only listen to serious offers."Omar Abdulrahman is a national treasure, which is why the club is keen to study with great attention only serious offers that are beneficial to the player," he is quoted by The National."Omar is above having to go on trial to prove his skills, as he has played high-quality league and international matches, which are the real test."Any club willing to recruit Omar can check his performance in all his games and then submit a serious offer to sign him. If there is one, we are ready to negotiate with the team and reach a compromise."
