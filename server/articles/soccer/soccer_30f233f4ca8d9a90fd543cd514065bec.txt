England will not be seeded for the World Cup draw in December despite moving up seven places to No 10 in the world rankings.FIFA is using the rankings released on Thursday to determine the seeds for the tournament, with hosts Brazil and the top qualified teams sure to be kept apart in the group stage.Roy Hodgson's side will therefore be in pot two and will be drawn into a group which includes one of Brazil, Spain, Germany, Argentina, Colombia, Belgium, Switzerland and either Uruguay or the Netherlands when the draw is made on 6 December.
