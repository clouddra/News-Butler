West Ham United captain Kevin Nolan has bemoaned the lack of international chances for his English team-mates.England boss Roy Hodgson was in attendance for the Hammers' impressive 3-0 win at Tottenham but, despite having five Englishmen in their starting line-up, not one player received a call-up for the recent World Cup qualifiers against Montenegro and Poland.Nolan, who has represented England at under-21 level, believes that Sam Allardyce's side are often ignored by the national team, regardless of how well they are performing."There's eight months to go to the World Cup and West Ham have probably got the biggest, strongest English set of players in the country. I don't think there's anyone like us," he told the Sun."It feels like the England manager doesn't seem to notice us. Hodgson was at our game at Spurs but that was because everyone had been talking about Jermain Defoe."But you can't tell me he went there and Ravel Morrison or Stewart Downing, James Tomkins and Mark Noble at least didn't catch the eye. He must be thinking there's at least four lads there he could call up."It's very frustrating. We finished 10th last year and the boss has strengthened the squad in the summer. If those lads were from other European countries, they would have caps."Nolan also pointed the finger at the influx of overseas players in the Premier League as one of the reasons for England's failings in recent years."Something must be done about the amount of foreign players. Playing with the best players makes it best for the Premier League, but does it make it the best for England?" said Nolan."Joe Hart is the only Englishman at Man City getting regular games. Joleon Lescott would get in most Premier League sides and you have Micah Richards and James Milner."They have got Champions League experience and trophies but they are certainly not regulars. Those boys should be Man City's main men in my eyes."
