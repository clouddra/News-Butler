Pep Guardiola insists he does not want to turn Bayern Munich into a new Barcelona, rather nurture the qualities already at the club.The former Barcelona boss won countless trophies with his old club, including the treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League in his first season in charge in 2008/09.Guardiola took over at Bayern in the summer after they had completed their own treble and he insists he does not wish to turn his new side into his old.In comments reported by La Gazzetta dello Sport, Guardiola is quoted as saying: "I don't want to transform Bayern in a new Barca."The mentality is different, and the style, the environment, the culture, the players too. This club has won too much to copy others."I came here because I wanted to coach these players."Bayern Munich are bigger than my ideas. I have only to maintain last season's level, of an unbeatable team that played in an incredible way."A coach must understand the qualities of his men and be able to take advantage of these."
