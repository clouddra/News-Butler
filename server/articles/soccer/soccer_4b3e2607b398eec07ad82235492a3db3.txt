Coverage: Live on BBC Three & BBC Radio 5 live sports extra    England Women and Wales Women meet at Millwall with both teams boasting a 100% record in qualifying so far.
    Hosts England scored 14 goals without reply against Belarus and Turkey while Wales beat Belarus 1-0 in their opener.
    Acting England coach Brent Hills said: "This fixture always stands out. I'm sure it will be a special occasion for both sets of players, staff and fans."
    Wales coach Jarmo Matikainen added: "This will show us where we are in terms of our development."
    Matikainen admitted that his side were the underdogs, adding: "England are a top side, but we must remember that this is a long qualifying group. The bulk of matches are in 2014 and on Saturday there are still only three points on offer.
    "I think we have a good blend of experience as well as some good, young talent. It is a balancing act as regards individual players' fitness because the Super League has ended, and we also have several players on their way back to full fitness from injury, such as Loren Dykes.
    "I understand that there will be a good crowd at Millwall and I am sure that our girls will really enjoy it, because at international level, you still have to enjoy the challenge."
    England counterpart Hills, who is in the running to take the job vacated by Hope Powell, has brought Birmingham defender Laura Bassett into his squad in place of the injured Anita Asante.
    "Neither side will want to lose, but our target is another win so we'll put in the same amount of effort as we always do," added Hills.
    The match will be played on the day of the Football Association's 150th anniversary celebrations.
    England striker Ellen White said: "This is a massive game against Wales. They're going to be really up for it, we're going to be really up for it.
    "I've never played against Wales. It's going to be a new experience. I'm sure they'll bring a lot of fans, and I hope we get plenty too."
