Toulouse defender Jonathan Zebina has revealed that a lack of first-team football has led him to ponder a move to the MLS.The 35-year-old returned to his native France in 2012 after a successful spell in Italy with Cagliari, Roma and Juventus and Brescia.He has, however, struggled for game time and has taken in just one minute of competitive action this term.Zebina is reluctant to spend life on the sidelines at this stage of his career and is considering his options heading forward.An American adventure holds plenty of appeal and he will explore MLS options in January if his situation at Toulouse fails to improve.Zebina told beIN Sport: "You have to remain positive, but things start to become complicated."I will try to change the situation, but if nothing changes before the winter break then I will try to find a different solution."A favoured destination? USA would be perfect. It is a country that has always attracted me and one where football is developing."
