England's women eased to a fourth straight World Cup qualifying win with a commanding 4-0 victory over Turkey.Eni Aluko, Fara Williams, Toni Duggan and Jordan Nobbs were all on target in Adana as interim coach Brent Hills extended his perfect record in charge.With the campaign to reach Canada 2015 now on hold until April, the FA will consider a permanent replacement for Hope Powell, who was sacked in August after a disappointing European Championship.But with a maximum points haul that leaves the side nine points clear of second-placed Wales - and without a single goal conceded to their 20 scored - Hills is in pole position to take the job on a full-time basis.England put eight past Turkey when the sides met at Fratton Park last month as Duggan plundering a quick-fire double inside three minutes, but 10 minutes had passed in their latest meeting before Aluko opened the scoring from 15 yards.The Chelsea forward soon drew a penalty that Williams comfortably dispatched, Sibel Duman punished for handling a left-wing cross, and would have claimed a second shortly before the break were it not for an offside flag.Duggan converted from a corner three minutes after the restart to make it 3-0 and though Aluko cracked an upright from 20 yards, a fourth arrived when another Duggan header bounced off the underside of the bar and ricocheted off Nobbs (60).
