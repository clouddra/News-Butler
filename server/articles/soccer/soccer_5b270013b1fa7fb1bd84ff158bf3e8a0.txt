Coverage: BBC Sport website, BBC Radio 5 live    England goalkeeper Joe Hart will remain on the bench for the Champions League visit of CSKA Moscow, says Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini.
    Hart 
    
was dropped 

     for Saturday's 
    
7-0 Premier League home win over Norwich City, 

     with Costel Pantilimon starting.
    Pellegrini said Romania international Pantilimon will continue in goal when City host the Russian side on Tuesday.
    "I don't know when Joe will come back to the team. We will see in the future what we must do," said Pellegrini.
    Hart, 26, has been under pressure after a string of high-profile mistakes, the last of which cost City a point as they were beaten 
    
2-1 by Chelsea 

     on October 27.
    Pellegrini added: "It is very important for him to have a rest. He has played all the matches in the last two and a half years."
    Captain Vincent Kompany (groin) and striker Stevan Jovetic (calf) remain on the sidelines as City seek back-to-back victories over CSKA after a 
    
2-1 win 

     at the Khimki Arena on 23 October.
