Brentford manager Uwe Rosler is out to make Griffin Park a fortress again - starting against Shrewsbury on Saturday.The Bees boasted the best home record in League One last season with 14 wins and only three defeats, but have already lost twice in front of their own fans this term.However, they got back to winning ways by beating Colchester at home last weekend before claiming victory at Bristol City in midweek to climb to seventh.And with Griffin Park chiefs making Saturday's clash a 'pay what you can' fixture to ensure a packed house and raise money for charity, Rosler is determined to send the fans home happy."We had some great atmospheres at Griffin Park last season, we raised the average attendance and filled the ground on a number of occasions," he said."It was not usual for Brentford and I think everybody enjoyed it. Not just the players, manager and coaching staff, I think the supporters enjoyed seeing Griffin Park full and with a fantastic atmosphere. We have to recreate that sort of atmosphere."But that is not only up to the supporters, it is up to us. We have to be a force at home."When we are a force and win most of our games, the supporters will come in numbers We have to start our momentum in home games and I am sure our supporters will support us."The supporters have a chance to turn out in numbers next week and help us build on the win over Colchester."Many thousands have already bought their tickets and that is great news. Hopefully over the next few days we can fill the ground and I believe the players will give that crowd something to remember."
