Newcastle manager Alan Pardew insists revenge will not be on his mind when he takes his side to local rivals Sunderland on Sunday.United were beaten 3-0 by the Wearsiders in their last meeting but that proved to be one of the few highlights during Paolo Di Canio's tenure.Pardew has also tested himself against Steve Bruce and Martin O'Neill but he will be in the opposite dugout to Gus Poyet at the Stadium of Light."It's just difficult sometimes. Clubs are trying to find the right solution to go forward," Pardew said of the regular managerial changes at Sunderland.

Every club has its own different style."It's a difficult environment to be a Premier League manager, or any manager in the north-east."You can't change the past. That will always be Paolo's day."For us, it's a different game and hopefully a much better performance from us and also a result, of course."But in terms of the game, I think it will be very, very similar to all the other games that I have had."Very, very competitive, not much in it, and one or two moments of class will decide it."Watch Sunderland v Newcastle on Sky Sports 1 HD from 12:30pm on Sunday.
