October 26, 2013, 5:10pmIt was Bale's second substitute appearance in the last week after making a late cameo against Malaga last weekend as he works his way back to fitness.The Welshman is relishing his first experience of the Clasico showdown and insists he is fit to start if needed by Real coach Carlo Ancelotti."Yeah I am sure it will be an amazing experience, the most important thing is we try to win the game and get the three points and I am looking forward to it just like everyone else is," Bale told Sky Sports 2.Asked if we was fit enough to start against Barcelona, Bale added. "I am not too sure, I have had a few minutes this week and I have had a good week's training as well so I think I am fit enough and it is up to the manager now whether I play from the start or am on the bench."Bale also thanked Cristiano Ronaldo for helping him settle into life at the Bernabeu after the Portuguese superstar spoke out in support of the former Tottenham man ahead of the Juventus clash."Yeah he has been absolutely amazing with me," added Bale."He has given me a lot of confidence and I think he has been in the position before so he has been great with me, everybody has been great in the changing room and I felt very settled straight away and I am just looking forward to kicking on now."I am enjoying everything about Real Madrid at the moment, obviously it was a bit disappointing to get the injury but that is behind me now and I just want to kick on now, play as well as I can and do my best for the team."
