    Manager Steve Clarke admits 
    
West Brom's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace 

     was "not a classic" but is pleased his side won in such "difficult conditions".
    Substitute Saido Berahino calmly fired the hosts ahead just before the break and Gareth McAuley headed in to condemn Crystal Palace to a seventh successive league defeat.
    Clarke praises Berahino's performance as he scored after replacing the injured Billy Jones, but the Baggies boss admits he was initially unsure whether to bring on the England Under-21 international.
