Hoffenheim have confirmed they lodged an official complaint with the German Football Association in dispute of Stefan Kiessling's 'ghost goal' which handed Bayer Leverkusen a 2-1 win at the Rhein-Neckar Arena on Friday night.

Kiessling's 70th-minute header went through the side netting, but referee Felix Brych allowed the goal -- which proved to be a decisive one -- to stand.
Using television replays as evidence, Hoffenheim have called for the match to be replayed.

"Hoffenheim have formally submitted an appeal to the German Football Association [DFB] against the validity of the home match against Bayer Leverkusen," a statement on the club's official website read. "The aim of the lawyer's letter via mail and fax is to request a replay of the match."

Following the match, Hoffenheim coach Markis Gisdol said: "It's definitely bitter for us and something like this has already happened once, and that game was replayed so I think we're going to see this game again. "Anything else would be a joke. You can't replay a Bayern Munich game, but not a Hoffenheim game."

Leverkusen boss Sami Hyypia added: "I celebrated during the game because it looked like it was in, but of course now it's a bit uncomfortable. But I can't do anything about it -- it's the referee who makes the decisions."
