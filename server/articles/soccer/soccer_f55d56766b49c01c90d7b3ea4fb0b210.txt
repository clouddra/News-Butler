John Arne Riise says there is no guarantee he will be leaving Fulham and has expressed a desire to head home at some stage before he hangs up his boots.The 32-year-old full-back recently admitted that a switch away from Craven Cottage would appear to be on the cards this summer.He confirmed that there is an agreement in place for him to leave on a free transfer, and Bundesliga outfit Werder Bremen are reported to be keen on acquiring his services.No deal has been put in place, though, and Riise could form part of Fulham's plans for their Premier League season opener at Sunderland on Saturday.He told Betsson: "The pre-season has been good in all aspects."I am looking forward to fighting for league points again. We will see if that is at Fulham or somewhere else."Riise has reiterated that it is his intention to remain away from his Norwegian roots for another couple of years, but admits he would like to bring the curtain down on his career in the Tippeligaen.He added: "The plan is to stay another two or three years abroad."I have said in the past that I was not tempted to end my career in the Tippeligaen, but I have started to change my mind. A year or so in the Tippeligaen might be nice."
