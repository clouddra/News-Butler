Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has decided not to appeal a two-game touchline ban sanctioned by UEFA for his confrontation of the fourth official during their opening Champions League Group F defeat to Napoli.Klopp, who has already served one game of the suspension and will also follow his side's trip to Arsenal later this month from the stands, says he will reluctantly accept the decision and move on."My main motive is that I would not like to give the impression that I am trivialising my misbehaviour or wanting to divert attention from it," he said."I stand up to my responsibility and accept this decision, as hard as it may be."Once again, assistant coach Zeljko Buvac will give the orders from the bench at the Emirates Stadium and Klopp has every faith in him."I trust Zeljko and his work," Klopp said in a press release."He is the best coach I have ever known in my life."Dortmund beat Marseille 3-0 at the start of October in Klopp's absence, although he said afterwards he had been able to follow the game better from his different vantage point.
