    Malky Mackay should not have to plead his case or present his managerial credentials to Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan - 
    
promotion to the Premier League 

     is testament enough.
    If, however, the flamboyant and controversial Tan needed any more confirmation that he should not attempt to fix something that is not broken, then the conclusion of a night of passion and fervour in the Welsh capital should provide the most compelling proof.
    As Cardiff 
    
closed in on victory in their 106th south Wales derby meeting with Swansea City, 

     one chant among the taunts traded relentlessly between supporters carried the greatest significance.
    Mackay, standing rain-soaked on the touchline where he had spent the duration of the 1-0 win, heard his name echoing around the Cardiff City Stadium. The Scot's stock was high among the fans before this game - delivering one of the most memorable days in the club's recent history will only continue its ascent.
Tan invested in the club in 2010.
