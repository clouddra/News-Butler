    A double from Kris Doolan ensured Inverness suffered their first home defeat of the season in a controversial match in the Highlands.
    Doolan put Partick ahead, firing low under Dean Brill after 20 minutes.
    Aaron Doran thought he had levelled, but the goal was ruled out after officials ordered a corner be re-taken.

    With Partick having encounters against Aberdeen and Celtic to come, manager Alan Archibald will have been delighted to grab a vitally important victory.
    But where luck had perhaps evaded them in recent weeks, they certainly got the fortune in this game, with a contentious refereeing decision and Brill's gift to Doolan shortly before the end.
    Second-placed Inverness will have felt aggrieved to have the lost the match with Celtic dropping points on Saturday.
    However, on the evidence of the opening period, they might have thought their home record would be safe as they took the game to the visitors.
