Striker Andy Johnson is ready to give QPR's promotion bid a lift after recovering from injury.The striker has been sidelined for a month with a hamstring problem but came through a midweek reserve match unscathed to put himself in the frame for Saturday's top-of-the-table clash with Burnley."I was delighted to be back out there," he told the club's website."I felt good, I felt sharp and it was a good run-out for me. It was important for me to get some minutes under my belt."I've been back in training for over a week now and I feel fine."I was only out for four weeks, it was only a minor hamstring injury, but it feels good to be back playing again."
