Mansfield manager Paul Cox apologised to the club's fans after his side's 3-0 defeat at Southend.Both teams had players sent off in the first half with on-loan Mansfield striker James Alabi, making his debut after signing from Stoke this week, and Southend midfielder Conor Clifford seeing red.The Stags finished the game with nine men after midfielder Lee Beevers was dismissed in the closing stages after receiving a second yellow card.In between the red cards there were also goals. Anthony Straker struck after 25 minutes and a Alan Marriott own goal a minute before half-time sent the Shrimpers into the break in control. Kevan Hurst, once of Chesterfield, completed the scoring in injury time."I can only apologise to our fans that have travelled because that just wasn't good enough," said Cox."We played poorly but things didn't go our way either."I thought the red card on first view looked harsh but I can't make a comment until I have seen the replay."I'm still confused by the second goal we conceded because we viewed it at half-time and I've been told he wasn't over the line, but these things happen."I can only reiterate how poorly we performed and I said a few words to the boys afterwards but I will keep that between me and the team."
