The Portland Timbers and Real Salt Lake shared the spoils as their top of the table clash ended in a scoreless draw at Jeld-Wen Field.Royals goalkeeper Nick Rimando came up big on multiple occasions for his team, denying Kalif Alhassan in the 65th minute with a composed reflex stop before topping that in stoppage time. He made the initial punch to deny Will Johnson's free kick and then parried Sal Zizzo's headed follow up from close range.The failure by either side to score a goal means that neither can win the MLS Supporters' Shield on its own merits. Portland (13-5-15) is first in the West with 54 points and RSL (15-10-8) is one place and point behind, but both trail overall leader Sporting Kansas City on 55, and New York could still overtake all of them with a win over Houston on Sunday.Portland is already qualified for the playoffs and will lock up top seed in the West with a win over last-place Chivas USA next week, and Real faces the same opposition on Wednesday, needing just a point to formalize its postseason attendance.
