Manuel Pellegrini insists he has "no complaint" with Jose Mourinho as the pair prepare to go head-to-head on Sunday.Mourinho succeeded the Chilean at Real Madrid before returning to the Premier League with Chelsea, while Pellegrini's career path took him from the Bernabeu to Malaga and on to Manchester City this summer.Reports of bad blood between the pair stem from a comment made by Mourinho on his arrival at Real, when he said: "If they get rid of me I won't be going to coach Malaga. I will go to a big club in the Premier League."Mourinho went on to win six of his eight meetings with Pellegrini's Malaga during his time in Spain, drawing another and losing just once.
