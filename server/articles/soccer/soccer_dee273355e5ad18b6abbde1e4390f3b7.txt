Getafe and Elche both extended their recent winning runs in La Liga as Sevilla let a two-goal lead slip away to Real Valladolid.Getafe recorded a fourth successive win in La Liga after beating 10-man Granada 2-0 away from home.Granada defender Pape Diakhate was sent off on 31 minutes for a foul on Fernandez Borja - a decision that did not go down well with team-mates Roberto and Diego Buonanotte who were booked.An own goal then gifted Getafe the lead two minutes after half-time when Jeison Murillo had the seemingly simple task of hacking clear a low cross into the area, but instead conspired to slice the ball off the wrong side of his foot and past Roberto.Getafe then all but sealed the points seven minutes later with a superb Pedro Leon finish when the former Real Madrid man side-footed into the far corner after being teed up by Pablo Sarabia.Elche played most of the second half with 10 men to hang on for a 2-1 win at Real Betis to post a third win in a row.The away side took the lead against the run of play with just under half an hour played when Dominga Cisma cut inside from the left and delivered a short but accurate cross to Manu Del Moral, who headed into the bottom corner.The second goal came just a few minutes later when Coro ran on to a long punt up field and held the ball up patiently inside the area before laying it off to Fidel Chaves, who took one touch before shooting into the bottom corner.Betis were soon allowed back into the game when Jorge Molina headed home a free-kick from Salva Sevilla, despite being offside when the ball was played.Cisma was sent off one minute into the second half for a second yellow card but, even with an extra player, Betis' search for an equaliser proved elusive thanks in no small part to the heroics of Elche goalkeeper Manu Herrera.Real Valladolid scored twice in the final 10 minutes to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to Sevilla.Carlos Bacca put Sevilla in front after just two minutes and the away side increased their lead on 31 minutes through Alberto Moreno.Former Manchester United striker Manucho came off the bench to pull one back for Valladolid on 81 minutes and three minutes later Patrick Ebert scored the equaliser.Rayo Vallecano overcame the sending off of Saul Niguez to run out 1-0 winners at Almeria thanks to Alejandro Galvez's free-kick.The visitors were reduced to 10 men shortly after the hour mark when Saul was sent off for his second yellow card in 10 minutes, the second a shove on Suso.The only goal of the game came with 12 minutes left when Galvez stepped up to take a free-kick just to the right of the penalty area. The defender curled the ball right into the top corner to give the visitors the lead they had deserved on balance.
