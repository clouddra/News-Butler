Real Madrid ace Gareth Bale claims rumours over his fitness were blown out of proportion after he made a successful return to action in Saturday's win over Malaga.Reports last week suggested Bale faced a lengthy spell on the sidelines as he was suffering from a slipped disc in his back with Real Madrid moving quickly to reject the speculation.Bale came off the bench to win a penalty in Real's 2-0 victory over Malaga and the world's most expensive player insists the injury rumours were exaggerated and that he is now back to fitness."It was just a little thigh strain that was blown massively out of proportion," Bale Real Madrid TV. "It is just a minor injury and I'm back now."I've not had a lot of game time, pre-season, training or running so you pick up little niggles."I have to take one step at a time. I've not had much training or games. It's all about building me up now."
