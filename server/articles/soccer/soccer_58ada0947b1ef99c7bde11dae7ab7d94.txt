Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp has confirmed his interest in Colombian striker Duvan Zapata.West Ham had launched a bid for the 22-year-old last month, and had started the work permit application before opting to pull out of a deal earlier this week.However, now QPR have stepped in and are ready to try and land the Estudiantes striker."Yeah I've seen him only on clips and everything. We've watched bits and pieces of him. We watched him play last week on TV against Atletico Madrid. Big lad, goalscorer, powerful," he said.When asked about the prospect of a move, he added: "Possibly, am not sure what the situation will be there."It's something we have been talking about. He's one of several options that we've got at the moment."The player himself has previously said he was happy to stay with Estudiantes, but he has revealed that he could quit because of unpaid wages."They owe me and my team-mates money and do not seem to be willing to resolve things," he is quoted by Argentine daily Ole."The president lies and they owe me a lot of money, there's no point them improving my contract if they don't pay me what they owe."There is renewed interest from Queens Park Rangers in me. I don't know what will happen with my future and I don't want leave on bad terms with the fans because of the words of the president."
