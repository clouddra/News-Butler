St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright is keen for centre-back Sanel Jahic to sign a long-term deal at the club.The 31-year-old Bosnia international has played for both AEK Athens and APOEL Nicosia, the latter of whom he represented in the Champions League.And Wright is keen for Jahic, who is on trial, to stay after Steven Anderson was ruled out for eight weeks following surgery on his dislocated thumb, while former Doncaster midfielder Martin Woods has been released."Sanel is still in and Martin has gone back," Wright told the Daily Record. "I don't have the funds to add both."I would have liked to have signed Martin but my priorities are defensive cover."I would love to keep Sanel here. He is a very good player and has an impressive pedigree, including Champions League experience."He would be a really good addition because he can also play at right-back and as a sitting midfielder."He has fitted in well and I have spoken to the chairman Steve Brown about financing a deal."
