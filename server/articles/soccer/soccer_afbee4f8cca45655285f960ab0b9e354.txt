Daniel Wass is all smiles.A stoppage-time penalty from Cedric Mongongu handed Evian their third consecutive win as they beat Toulouse 2-1 on Saturday night.Serge Aurier fired Toulouse ahead after a goalless first half but Daniel Wass equalised just nine minutes later and it looked as thought the points were going to be shared.But in the second minute of time-added-on, Mongongu was felled inside in the area and he picked himself off the floor to fire past Ali Ahamada and seal the win.The result leaves the two teams locked in mid-table on 15 points.Evian had the first chance of note as Eric Tie Bi found Pape Sougou who beat two men as he advanced on goal but could only fire his shot wide of the post.Just before the half hour Toulouse could have opened the scoring when Eden Ben Basat released Wissam Ben Yedder on the edge of the penalty area but his quick shot was saved by Jesper Hansen in the home goal.Just two minutes later the home side broke forward and Cedric Barbosa got a good shot away but Uros Spahic cleared as the first half finished goalless.The second period was just seven minutes old when Toulouse took the lead through Aurier.Clement Chantome's corner was cleared but only as far as the penalty sport where Aurier was on hand to volley home past Ahamada.Three minutes later the scores could have been level when Sougou sent Wass free on the edge of the area but Ahamada made a smart save to tip his shot onto the post.The home side didn't have to wait too long for their equaliser though and were level in the 61st minute.Sougou found Nicolas Benezet whose shot from distance was only parried by Ahamada and Wass was there to head in the rebound.The game went into a lull and it looked like the points would be shared before Steeve Yago brought down Mongongu and the Congolese defender sent Ahamada the wrong way.
