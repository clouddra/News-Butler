France have been given a tough draw against Ukraine in the World Cup play-offs.France - winners of the World Cup in 1998 and finalists in 2006 - finished second behind Spain in Group I.They will go to Ukraine, the runners-up behind England in Group H, first with the second leg in France.Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal will take on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Sweden in what could be two very tight play-off matches.Greece will face Romania and Iceland have probably been given the draw they wanted against Croatia.The Croats go into the play-offs in a state of some disarray. They lost their last two matches and sacked coach Igor Stimac last week.Iceland have never qualified for a major tournament before.The four winners will qualify for the finals in Brazil next year.France boss Didier Deschamps said: "We were not seeded and could have played Portugal or Croatia who have a long history, but Ukraine is not a simple draw either."They are on a run of seven matches without defeat and they concede very few goals as well as a long trip over there. It's good to have the return leg at home but one team will qualify and the other will be staying home for the World Cup."We have to have a lot of confidence and respect the opposition."Sweden's matches with Portugal are arguably the most attractive of the quartet and coach Erik Hamren said: "World-class players like Ronaldo and Ibrahimovic, they do something extra to change the game. I am pleased we have one, too. But we need our team to be really good."Portugal boss Paulo Bento added: "They will be evenly balanced and very competitive games. Ibrahimovic is an imposing figure, but the Swedes are more than that, they are good collectively."Greece coach Fernando Santos admitted he would have preferred to play the first match in Romania, rather than at home."My message to the fans is that they should believe in the national team, go to the stadium, fill it, and put pressure on our opponents," Santos said.Iceland boss Lars Lagerback said: "I think Croatia is okay. The advantage is I know the new coach (Niko Kovac) a little bit and I also had experience against Croatia when I was coaching the Swedish team so I know what we can expect."We have a pretty good team so, even if we're not the favourites, look out for Iceland."Draw:Portugal v SwedenUkraine v FranceGreece v RomaniaIceland v CroatiaMatches will take place on 15th and 19th of November.
