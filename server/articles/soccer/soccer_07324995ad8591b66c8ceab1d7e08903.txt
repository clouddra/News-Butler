The LA Glaxy limped into the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF Champions League, but had to endure a 4-0 embarrassment at the hands of Isidro Metapan and Nico Munoz.With progress already assured, Bruce Arena elected to field a raw lineup against eh El Salvadoran side, and paid the price.Panamanian striker Munoz punished the Galaxy with four goals in the first half. His first was a free kick in the 29th minute, which embarrassingly beat Brian Rowe at his near post from some distance. In the 31st minute, poor defending allowed a pass to get through the back line and find him, and after a moment of good close control, he tucked home from short range. The sometime Panama internationalpicked up his third in the 33rd minute. A nice through ball from the wide area was just beyond the reach of the Galaxy defenders, and Munoz beat the trap and the Rowe to seal his hat trick.He then scored a beautiful effort to take his fourth. Taking a ball over the top, Munoz worked a nice turn around AJ DeLaGarza and chipped a lofted ball over Rowe and into the net.Previously perfect, the Galaxy (3-0-1) move on to face Club Tijuana in the next round.
