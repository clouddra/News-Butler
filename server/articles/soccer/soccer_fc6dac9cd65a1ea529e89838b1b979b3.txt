Chesterfield striker Jacob Hazel is considering a loan switch to Norwegian club Moss FK.Hazel, who has signed a new one-year contract with the Spireites, has flown out to Norway where he will spend the week and discuss the potential move.Any deal with the third-tier side would be a six-month loan.Blues boss Paul Cook said: "There are areas of Jacob's game that he must improve and we feel that he needs a bit more time because he has the priceless ability to score goals."Six months in a foreign country would be a great experience for him and it would further his football education."Hazel made his Chesterfield debut as a substitute in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy against Oldham in September.The 19-year-old then made his League debut shortly afterwards in a 2-2 draw at York before loans spells at Matlock Town and Workington later in the season.
