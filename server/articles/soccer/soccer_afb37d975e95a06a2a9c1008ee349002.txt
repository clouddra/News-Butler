    Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini warns CSKA Moscow fans against repeating their 
    
racist abuse of City midfielder Yaya Toure 

     on Tuesday.
    The sides meet again in the Champions League two weeks after Toure was targeted during City's 2-1 win in Russia, 
    
with Uefa ordering the partial closure of CSKA's stadium during the club's next home tie.
    Pellegrini also confirmed Joe Hart would remain on the bench, with Costel Pantilimon 
    
 set to continue in goal.
