Swansea manager Michael Laudrup has backed Michu to secure a place in Spain's World Cup squad.The 27-year-old forward made his debut for La Roja in last week's World Cup qualifier against Belarus, having been called up by Vicente del Bosque following an injury to David Villa.Michu's prolific form in scoring 27 goals for the Swans since joining from Rayo Vallecano in the summer of 2012, had impressed Del Bosque enough for him to travel to watch him in Premier League action.Now Michu has won his first cap, he will hope to be a part of their World Cup defence in Brazil.Laudrup accepts it will be a difficult task given the quality of players Del Bosque has at his disposal, but believes Michu has what it takes to be involved next summer, provided he maintains his club form.He said: "He can make the World Cup squad, he has already proved it."Like in every squad there will be players who will be automatic selections and Vicente del Bosque will already know who."Players like Sergio Ramos, Andres Iniestia and Xavi, a certain number of players are already there."But for the final three or four places it will depend."Is it Roberto Soldado, Alvaro Negredo, Michu, Fernando Torres or David Villa? Will they take two of the five or three of the five?"We are talking about a high level there so I think it will depend on what they are doing with their clubs in the last months of the season."Laudrup believes Swansea can only benefit from the confidence Michu will have gained from his first international experience.









"Michu and Swansea can be very proud as it must be one of the most difficult squads to get into as a player."

"Michu and Swansea can be very proud as it must be one of the most difficult squads to get into as a player."Michael Laudrup"It's huge, I would imagine for a player like Michu as the players who get to go into the national team come from the big clubs," he said."In Spain the big ones are Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Valencia, Malaga, Athletic Bilbao, but he was from Rayo and then he joined us."Already last season there was talk about playing a friendly or two, but this was a qualifier and he started."It's not just about the World Cup, but playing for the World and European champions."In the last four years they have won everything so Michu and Swansea can be very proud as it must be one of the most difficult squads to get into as a player."But that's what happens when you are born in a country with so many good players."It gives you the possibility to go to the World Cup, but it means it makes it very difficult to get into the squad."
