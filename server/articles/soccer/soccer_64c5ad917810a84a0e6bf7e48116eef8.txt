Serbia's bitter football rivals are set to incur the wrath of UEFA after crowd trouble marred the Belgrade derby.Red Star Belgrade triumphed against arch-rivals and league leaders Partizan on Saturday, courtesy of a first-half own goal from Milan Obradovic, but unrest in the stands drew unwanted headlines.Partizan fans set off fireworks before kick-off and then threw flares onto the track surrounding the pitch at the Marakana stadium.Firefighters were summoned to tackle multiple blazes and referee Milorad Mazic was forced to halt play for 10 minutes while smoke dissipated.The incident is the latest in a string of disturbances on the terraces of Europe.Spartak Moscow were last week fined and ordered to play two games behind closed doors after fans threw flares, smoke bombs and seats during a Russian Cup tie against second-tier side Shinnik Yaroslavl.
