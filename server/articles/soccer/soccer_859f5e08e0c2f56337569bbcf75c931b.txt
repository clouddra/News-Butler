For that, I am most grateful."I'd like to thank so many people for making so many aspects of this journey possible. My family has always been a tremendous support, especially my mom, Dora, and my late father, Dudley. I trust that I have made them proud in some small way."Sponsors, like Nike, who have been there for me for the past 15 years and I appreciate that. And finally, my mentor and business manager, Rob Moore, who has walked along this road with me since I joined him in 1995 as a 17 year-old."McCarthy will now take some time out away from the game as he gears up for his next challenge."Football is my life. I have played the game and I love the game, it's in my blood," he said."For the next chapter, I'd like to concentrate on getting my Coaching Badges and at the same time, be part of a club where I can get practical experience. I'd also like to do some television work because I enjoy that aspect of the game as well."
