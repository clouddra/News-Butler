    Manager Manuel Pellegrini is "very happy" with Manchester City's "complete" performance in 
    
thrashing Norwich 7-0, 

     their record Premier League win.
    Bradley Johnson's own goal put City ahead before strikes from David Silva, Matija Nastasic and Alvaro Negredo gave City a 4-0 half time lead.
    In the second half the Blues continued to "move the ball quickly" as Yaya Toure's free kick, a Sergio Aguero finish and substitute Edin Dzeko's goal rounded off the scoring.
    Pellegrini dropped England goalkeeper Joe Hart and says everyone at the club must "work behind him so he can return as soon as possible".
