Manager Ronnie Moore pulled no punches following Tranmere's 4-0 home defeat to Leyton Orient.Moore called the loss "embarrassing" and questioned the professionalism of defender Ian Goodison, who was needlessly sent off for striking O's striker Kevin Lisbie.The Rovers boss felt his side surrendered to the Sky Bet League One leaders, who maintained their unbeaten start to the campaign with two goals from Lisbie and efforts from Dean Cox and substitute Shaun Batt."The way we collapsed was embarrassing," said Moore, whose team are back in the relegation zone after a fifth defeat in six league games and are yet to win at home in the league all season."There was nothing in the game at half-time but Ian Goodison has done something stupid and let everybody down."With 10 men it will always be a tough battle but the white flag went up too easily."We had matched them in the first-half and I thought we didn't deserve to go in a goal down. But we left ourselves wide open after the sending off and that was down to a total lack of professionalism in that situation."You have to be disciplined and do the right things but they picked us off at ease because we were so lacklustre."We haven't won a game at home yet and we keep shooting ourselves in the foot."It is embarrassing when you concede the type of goals that we did."We need to lift the players and they need to help lift themselves."
