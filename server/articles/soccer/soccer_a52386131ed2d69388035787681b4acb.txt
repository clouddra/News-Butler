Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website    When Real Sociedad raced into the Champions League by finishing fourth in last season's La Liga and hammering Lyon 4-0 over two legs in August's final qualifying round, long-serving skipper Xabi Prieto had only one wish: to be drawn in the same group as Manchester United.
    Speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, the 30-year-old playmaking midfielder explained: "Ever since I was small, I have always really liked Manchester United. 
    "I used to have an Eric Cantona shirt - he was my favourite player. They are a mythical club, one of the biggest in the world, and the stadium has always really attracted me as well."
    Prieto got his wish, of course, with La Real placed alongside United, Shakhtar Donetsk and Bayer Leverkusen in a tough-looking Group A.
