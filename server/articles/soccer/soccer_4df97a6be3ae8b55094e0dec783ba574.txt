Sky Sports understands Leicester City defender Liam Moore is in line for a recall to the England Under-21 squad.The highly-rated Moore made his Under-21 debut last November as a late substitute in the friendly win over Northern Ireland.The 20-year-old has now emerged on the radar of U21 boss Gareth Southgate after impressing for Leicester this season.Moore, who has represented England at Under 17 level, has been an ever-present for the Foxes this term and has been instrumental in helping them to second spot in the Sky Bet Championship.Moore, who won the Football League's Young Player of the Month for September, has been forced to switch from centre-back to right-back in recent week dues to injuries and he has slotted into his new role with ease.Southgate and his coaching staff are thought to be keeping tabs on Moore and they are expected to maintain a watching brief on the defender during the next few weeks ahead of England's next European Championship qualifiers against Finland and San Marino next month.
